Having been unable to eat popcorn for more than 10 years, I was excited to find this product. I popped my first batch last night and was relatively disappointed in the amount of husks I found on the popped corn after popping. I had researched very closely many types of ""hull less"" popcorn, realizing that no popcorn is truly hull less. However, there were far more than I expected. The taste was delicious even though I went overboard on the butter and salt this time around. I'll chalk this up to lack of popping experience since I'm out of practice and will continue to perfect my skills hoping that better popping will result in fewer hulls. Only a few kernels were left unpopped and that was great!    UPDATE: After several attempts at popping this ""new to me"" popcorn - it's all I eat now. I guess there was a little bit of a learning curve to pop these small kernels and now I have it mastered. We bought a Hamilton Beach popcorn popper with the plastic dome lid and the little metal wand that spins in the bottom ""heating"" portion. I add the popcorn oil and let it get good and hot, pour in the popcorn and quickly put the bowl on top. The popcorn pops almost immediately. As soon as it almost stops popping, I invert the popper, add some butter and salt and we are good to go! I've repeatedly bought this popcorn and have never had any issues (and I've eaten bowl after bowl....).",1

I pop my corn in coconut oil, so good! Nice and tender, there are hulls but because they are so small you don't notice them. Would recommend this corn to anyone who loves popcorn.",0
B00M9M8MFC,2018-09-01,AGWP7XP6ZR3VKATVFDQ5ZQCZSLVQ,Kelly D Smith,5.0,Great Popcorn for Digestive Issues--THANK YOU!,"  Not an appetizing tagline, I know, but if you suffer from what I suffer from and still love popcorn, you will appreciate this. My husband and I are popcorn connoisseurs of a sort, and this Amish Country Lady Fingers is the best we've found after more than a decade of trying different brands and types. The popped kernels are very small and also hulless, which makes it the most digestible popcorn I've found to date (comparatively--mind you, it is still popcorn so you still have to be careful). The taste is perfect and every kernel pops every time. Six pounds doesn't last long in our house.",0

Alternate method tried: microwave with a little oil in a paper bag - did pop OK, but burned despite turning microwave power to 7 and listening closely. Amazon prime was kind enough to refund my money. I've been a regular popcorner for years, but recently found I have a serious GI issue and it was suggested I try the ""hulless"" variety. Perhaps another product will work better for me, at least in terms of popping it. Of note, the seller does state that one can use a hot air popper with their product. But beware, for me, this did not work at all.",0
B00M9M8MFC,2015-03-09,AGACLLWQEC2K54N7KTIXTNI7BAOA,Matt,5.0,The best I've tried.,"  The best taste and texture of any popcorn I've tried. Those that complain about it being tough are probably following the directions WVF gives, IE heat the oil with 2-3 kernels, wait for them to pop then add the full amount, this IME yields tough kernels and more partial popped ones. I use a great Northern stovetop stainless steel stir popper, I preheat the burner, but add the kernels, Flavacol, and coconut oil to a cold pot and get amazing results every time, light and crispy, full of flavor with a hint of sweetness, no need to add anything after the fact, just pour into bowls and devour. Slow even heating of the kernels yields light and fluffy corn, already hot oil pops a little faster but its always noticeably tougher.",1

I bought one bag which disappeared quite quickly and then we were without....eGads! So the search was on to purchase more of this delicious very small popcorn with little to no hulls left after popping. We were ecstatic to find a seller on Amazon and to be able to get this product in 6 lbs. The best part was to receive in a couple days and start popping away! Thank you for helping our addiction of popcorn stay alive....,0

I mean it tastes ok, but this stuff is so small I've resorted eating it witha spoon like cereal. The popped kernels are about the size of Cap'n Crunch. Oh and as far as the hulless claim...yeah right. This stuff has more hulls than average popcorn. But now I've got close to six pounds of it to get used to the stuff. Maybe I'll give it to someone and see if they like it.",0

I tried using them in my hot air popper, but that was a disaster because the kernels are so small as soon as you turn the air on they fly out of the machine.

The kernels are too light and blow out before they pop. If I angle my air popper WAY back, so that the kernels don't blow out early, it works, but this is a precarious setup that is a hassle.

B00M9M8MFC,2015-11-22,AE3QBQTIPP26DGMRWIQFIFZ5SMJQ,Sandy Lou,2.0,I hope this helps. We got this for my ...,"  I hope this helps. We got this for my mother-in-law at her request and kept a little for ourselves to try. Unfortunately we put it in the same container as our other popping corn.  Here's why I say unfortunately.:  The kernels are very, very small.  They have a high husk to popped corn ratio and so that's mostly what you end up tasting and crunching on when you eat it.  I'm kind of sensitive to texture, so it may bother me more than others.  I pop my pop corn in a pot with hot coconut oil (no flavor) and then sprinkle with sea salt. Very yummy...usually, but not with this stuff.",1

I will never use any other popcorn.    It took me a few tries to figure out how to cook it. It flies out of air poppers because it's so light. It's best to cook it in a microwave popcorn maker or on the stove in a covered pot.,0
B00M9M8MFC,2015-02-06,AF6FTPAM5BG5VESQR2GMGRICJJRA,ML,5.0,"If you've only ever had popular brand popcorn, you have NO IDEA what you're missing","  This popcorn is incredible. If the only popcorn you've experienced is the *Popular-Brandname-Popcorn* stuff from the store, you're in for the biggest treat.    First of all, this is ""hulless"" or ""very light hulls"" which means that all the popcorn shells that normally get stuck in your teeth / all over your gums / everywhere NO LONGER DO!! The kernels are so light that instead of always getting the hulls stuck in your teeth like popular namebrand popcorn, they very rarely get stuck in your teeth. This alone makes this popcorn hands down the best thing ever.. but wait there's more!    Secondly, this popcorn lasts a VERY long time. The kernels are very small but pop nice and fluffy. The bag will last you a very long time and you won't need to use that much with each popping. I use a WhirleyPop to pop the popcorn (which I also highly recommend) and all I have to do is lightly coat a single layer of popcorn on the bottom and I pop up a full WhirleyPop of popcorn.    Thirdly, the popcorn is delicious. Can't stop eating it. In fact I'm going to pop myself some right now.",1
B00M9M8MFC,2018-02-05,AE4EQQDZ53AXT2DX27CWH6MHHR7Q,emilyfletcher,4.0,Small and Delicate,"  I tried this because as a popcorn junkie I was getting tired of carefully eating around hull pieces that had a tendency to get caught in my throat. I was excited to see a hull-less kernel. Here's what I found: For the kernels that pop completely there is no hull. For those that don't they're still eatable and don't choke you, if you have healthy teeth. The kernel are really, really small and remain small when popped. You need to pop 3-4 handfuls to equal a bag of microwavable popcorn. Other than that I love the Lady Finger and it's a small price to pay for choke-less popcorn.",0
B00M9M8MFC,2013-01-12,AGGQ3HYL42R2FLYLV7O5OMFY6NAA,Duchino,5.0,Great Popcorn - very small kernels,"  I eat a lot of popcorn from my old Salton Hot-Air popper; and this is by far my favorite popcorn to use. ""Hull-less"" is not important to me; but the flavor is great and the popped kernels are very small so are more dense in the bowl.    I have three observations from my hot-air popping experience (6 pounds so far):  A) there is more chaff that blows onto the kitchen counter (I guess the commercial brands all blow-clean their popcorn?). It is like a little lint. I will try to shake it off in the future  B) I think it takes a bit longer to pop than major brands. Usually there is one big wave of popped product, then a delay of perhaps 30 to 45 seconds; then the remainder all pops. There are somewhat more unpopped kernels than with the major brands  C) Once in a great while in my hot air popper, the kernels get jammed in a mass and stop circulating in the blowing hot air. You need to just shake them loose or touch them with a plastic utensil and they go back on their way.    I am just noting these experiences for your guidance - nothing detracts from the fact that this is the best choice out there.    P.S. I just add salt to the hot air popcorn. To make it taste better, I mix in some packaged popcorn like Herr's, and the result has fewer calories and oil but tastes great.",1

Pros: The kernels are small and Hull-less so they don't get caught in your teeth like other types of kernels.  It is a good price for good popcorn.  Cons: Caution the bag is not always sealed and the kernels spill when I take it out of the box. This has happened twice.  Despite this issue I will continue to order this popcorn.,0

Some are great, others are nothing special.    This Lady Finger popcorn is truly unique. The kernels are tiny. You will use more of them to cover the bottom of your popper.  They pop up very small - the smallest popcorn I have ever seen, and they are very light, with a seemingly non-existent hull.

I do have a strange like/dislike relationship with this popcorn. My first impression was ""OMG, it's popping all over my kitchen"". My second impression was, ""Look how cute it is"", followed by ""this tastes REALLY good"". And finally, ""I need a spoon to eat this stuff"".    Love:  1. It truly is a very ""clean"" popcorn. The lack of hulls makes it 100% worthwhile  2. Taste: It's delicious.    Not so much love:  1. I suppose because the small seeds are so light, it is truly (as one review said) a volcanic erruption. I had to hold a towel over the opening to my air popper to assure the seeds stayed inside and didn't fly all over the kitchen. If you want to entertain small children, pets or even yourself, put in the recommended 1/2 cup and stand back and watch the show. You can totally get around this by adding a generous 3/4 cups of seeds instead of the ""do not exceed"" 1/2 cup. It has caused no problems with our popper.  2. Because the kernels are so small it's easy to drop them before you get them to your mouth. This doesn't bother me that much, but it was a deal breaker for my mother when she came for a visit.    Overall, I would definitely recommend this popcorn for it's taste. My 5-year old loves the small size so I'll break out my spoon and deal with the tiny kernels.",1

The first time I tried to make the popcorn in my hot-air popper, approximately 60% of the kernels blew out of the chamber un-popped into the bowl. The kernels are just TOO SMALL for it to pop correctly in the machine that I have been using for years. Personally, I have never seen kernels that small. I made a hasty decision because Amazon was temporarily out of my usual purchase (Great Northern 12.5# bag)  Most of the reviews mention that ""Ladyfinger"" will not work well in hot air or oil based poppers, right off the bat. I mean: ""what could go wrong with a bag of popcorn?"" Plenty, it seems. Will throw the rest of the corn out.",0

We have two kids in braces so thought this might be good popcorn for them. Taste is very good, but we've popped 6-7 batches in an air popper and there are way too many unpopped kernels and too many partially popped kernels that you have to chew very carefully so you don't bite down on them. Our cheap brand popped as well or better for a lot less money! Maybe we got a bad bag or need to cook it in oil on the stove to see if that helps.

I've tried all kinds of other varieties of popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms and this specific one is my favorite by far. The hulls are so small and delicate they don't get stuck in your teeth! The popcorn is also extremely flavorful. It is much more tasty then any of the popcorn I've ever bought at the grocery store. It is so delicate and delicious that you can actually eat the occasional ""old maid"" kernels that didn't pop without chipping teeth. It doesn't gain volume quite as dramatically as other varieties of popcorn, but it is more filling as a result. I like to pop it on the stove with some olive oil and then top it with half olive oil and half butter to further enhance the flavor. It is my favorite snack. Once you go with the ladyfinger popcorn, you'll never go back.",1

I am less than 25% of the way through the bag). It was very unpleasant and lingered on my palate. Not sure if anything can be done about this.

Noticeably smaller grind than typical table salt. But still large enough so that you can see individual grains of salt. Larger than the grind of Morton's Popcorn salt.    I think it is right on the cusp of where a coarser/finer grind won't/will stick to the popcorn. I uses an air-popper and then add unsalted* butter before salting, and it stuck so-so. I suspect it wouldn't stick at all if you used very light/no oil/butter. Or if you use an oil/stove popper you probably won't have any issue with the salt sticking to the popcorn.    *as an aside, if you haven't tried it yet try using unsalted butter. I swear it tastes better than salted butter. But hey, even if that's all in my head unsalted butter tends not to explode in the microwave as long as the dish is clean when you start.",1

I love big kernels of buttery, salty popcorn. Growing up my dad had a preference for tiny white popcorn which I think tends to be more tender but I was always disappointed in the size. Now that I'm making the purchasing decision I go for as big as I can get and yellow. How did I get this far without ever hearing of ""mushroom popcorn""?  I simply use an air popper and wasn't sure how this might turn out based on some reviews here and reading about the best way to pop this type of popcorn. I let my popper warm up for maybe 3-5 minutes before adding the popcorn. Once popped it was definitely mostly mushroom style popcorn, but I did have a small smattering of un-popped kernels on the bottom. I also noticed while eating it that if I ran into a partially popped kernel I had to be very careful. They are very hard and needed to be spit out for fear of breaking a tooth. However, I think these un-popped and partially popped kernels are a result of the air popper. I did a second batch of generic white after this and all of it popped (which is not the norm). I think this was because the entire popper was hot from the first batch. So, I'm satisfied and would both recommend and buy this product again. I know I've bought this brand before in stores but never saw the label, ""mushroom popcorn"", but it was a larger size yellow popcorn that said it was good for caramel corn.  Hmmm, I'm hungry now",0
B00M9MGUQ0,2017-07-06,AEUBDTYEFLXSG2MUCRYLOWY5FLIQ,Donna D.,5.0,Great popcorn!,"  I love this popcorn. I don't know why others are saying that it's soggy, chewy, butterfly, not popping, etc. I use this with a ""Whirlypop"" to make kettle corn. It's awesome. Almost every kernel pops and is delicious. I used to pay $8 for a bag of kettle corn at a fair or farmer's market. Now I make my own with this very popcorn and you can't tell the difference between my homemade and the $8 bag. For those of you looking to duplicate fair kettle corn, invest in a $19.99 Whirlypop at Bed Bath and Beyond (16.99 with online coupon). Use 1/4 cup of your favorite cooking oil, 1/4 cup of this mushroom popcorn, 1/2 tsp of salt and 3-4 Tbsp sugar. It's amazing.",0

It was funny. I purchased a bag of Baby White Amish for my mother, because of her sensitive teeth and gums and difficulty she had with the popcorn hull, I gave her a small bowl she couldn't finish. But when I made kettle corn with the Amish Country Mushroom she tried a little, she loved it, after that when I prepared the kettle corn and it was barely cooled she was right at the table getting herself a bowl to eat and when she finished her bowl she went back for the bag I put the kettle corn in.  I made one batch and I was lucky to get some. With the mushroom popcorn she didn't seem to mind the hull. It seemed to be less than the hull-less popcorn. However, I cooled the kettle corn on a baking sheet and parchment paper. It didn't take long to cool on the baking sheet, the un-popped kernels and hulls were mostly left behind when I scooped the kettle corn into the plastic bag I put the cooled kettle corn in.  There was some unpopped popcorn but not too bad. It was a bit expensive, however I will continue to purchase this.",0

The kernels were dark and small, and really shriveled and dried looking. When we popped them, they tasted hard and stale.    Because of the horrible batch we got from Hoosier Hill Farms, we decided to switch it up and order from Amish Country. SO GLAD WE DID! The popcorn was fantastic and great quality. They actually pop HUGE, the largest mushroom popcorn I've seen. They are so round and pillowy, with a fluffy texture. They are so perfect for seasoning. We make cheddar popcorn and kettle, and these get a really nice and even coating. Really happy with this purchase, and will definitely reorder when we burn through this bag.",0

They are 100% mushroom kernels, just as advertised. They pop big and round, look gorgeous and taste delicious.  Unfortunately, almost half of the kernels didn't pop. The shell is thicker on this kind of kernels, to I know they need a little more oil than the regular ones. I tried with different oil-kernel ratios and it's still the same result. Too much oil, they turn yellow; too little, they burn, but I still can't get half of them to pop.  I bought these as an experiment. They are already almost 4 times the price of the regular kernels, and at a 50% pop ratio, they end up at 8 times the price. It breaks my heart, but I won't buy them again...",0

It is out favorite of all the Amish kinds of popcorn. One thing to note, the hulls do not bother us, but beware if you are looking for a hull-less popcorn--this is not for you.

Fortunately, at least with the batch I got, this is definitely mushroom popcorn. Sure, there is some butterfly, but my estimate is that it's 80% mushroom popcorn, 70% at worst. Of the butterfly, it's like some of those kernals just couldn't quite make it to the ball shape. They tried though.    The popcorn itself is good. And it's big. Much bigger than store bought (e.g. JollyTime White, etc.). It is a bit chewy and definitely has more hulls than typical popcorn, but I'm fine with that. Overall, I love the large size and the texture. It feels like I'm eating something more substantial. It's good with Flavacol (though it takes more than I'm used to for good coverage), and it made really good caramel corn as well.    Finally, it pops fine for me. I use a StirCrazy and pop it following the normal StirCrazy guidelines. Nothing special needed. Sure, some kernals didn't pop, but nothing out of the ordinary.    Final verdict: Thumbs up. I would buy again (and I have -- 6lbs directly from their website).",0

However, this popcorn, while it does have a good popcorn taste, apparently needs a session in a hot oven to crisp it up. When I want a bowl of popcorn, I don't want to take any extra steps just to get what I should get just from popping it. It has a chewy texture that is disappointing. I thought I'd like having my kernels round in shape like this, but I'm finding that I prefer the butterfly corn, probably because there is more surface area to get crunchy. Live and learn . . .",0

It more round and spherical than butterfly popcorn that you buy in the store but the overall volume isn't that much bigger. I was looking for something closer to what we get when we go to the fair or other commercial popped popcorn. All that said, the taste of the popcorn is good and the product was delivered as advertised in other ways. Maybe it has more to do with the popping method than the product?",0

It pops into rounded, chewy kernels that carry the flavor nicely. If you shake it well right after popping then most of the hulls will detach. The hulls are normal for mushroom popcorn. I would not use this popcorn to make regular movie theater-style popcorn. If mushroom popcorn is what you are looking for then you will not be disappointed.",0

Popped on the stove top like OR's, there are unpopped kernals. I will not be buying this again.    UPDATE: it seems I may have been premature in my initial impression.

B00M9MGUQ0,2016-11-18,AFHJXN45MRDDFLVG7KEMEGVPFUVQ,Ben Amos,4.0,Updated review,"  The main reason I purchased this particular popcorn is because it claimed to be mushroom popcorn. Mushroom popcorn pops in balls and is perfect for flavored popcorns like caramel or kettle corn. I was excited to try this popcorn so the moment it was delivered I popped some. It's exactly the same type of popcorn I already had in the pantry.    After doing some research, I learned a lot about this type of popcorn. It's not only the type of popcorn but how you pop it that makes all the difference. I originally gave this popcorn 1 star but I've changed it to 4 after getting the correct popper for this type of corn.    The air-popper and the oil method are not the best way to pop this corn. You need a true popcorn popper. I used my Zippy and it came out beautifully! The kernels popped large and round just as described. The kernels (after cooling off) are crunchy and perfect for caramel and kettle corn. I highly recommend it if you have the correct popper. If you're using an air popper, save the money and stick with a non-GMO white popcorn. You won't be disappointed.",0

I have very few kernels left in the bottom of my bowl. I usually pop 1/2 c of kernels and maybe 10 are left unpopped. The key is to have a really hot oil.

B00M9MGUQ0,2018-11-25,AGQ3PVIEFWFK2BIGTYIOD4DP6Q5A,Rororosado,5.0,After popping let the popcorn cool slightly,  I love the popcorn and haven't been able to find the mushroom kernel. I literally refilled a popcorn bag that was purchased from the theater. People loved it so I'm thinking popcorn tins for Christmas. Could be a lot of fun. I just need the recipes.  I did pop the kernels in my Whirley pop with my coconut popping oil with the yellow season salt; hence the color. No butter and the finished product melts in my mouth. This popcorn was popped on Wednesday; photos taken today and taste wonderful.  Tip: let the popped popcorn cool a bit; otherwise it is chewy. If you order fresh popcorn at the movies same tip. I recommend the product; and if skeptical get the 1lb. I got the 2 lb and lasted 3 weeks. . .we love popcorn and very lucky about it. Enjoy,0

B00M9MGUQ0,2018-10-17,AGV6HDSN23JTBN4JWIP4R62AKSFQ,eqvet,2.0,Disappointing pop ratio and texture,"  I was searching for some ""mushroom"" popcorn to make kettle corn when I found this product. Although I noted some mixed reviews on it, I thought I'd give it a try. After trying multiple batches and methods of popping, I have to say that I'm not impressed. My popping methods for this included stove-top, microwave in a microwave popper (Nordic), and microwave in a brown paper bag. I have had good success with all three of these methods in the past with regular ""starburst pop"" popcorn. My first complaint is the ""pop ratio"". In all three methods, there was, in my opinion, an excessive amount of unpopped kernels. Even with the stove-top method (that usually pops probably 95% of the kernels), there were at least 30-40% of the kernels remained unpopped. With the microwave methods, the unpopped kernels were closer to 50%. My second complaint is the texture. The popcorn, to me, was very chewy in nature. Now, I know that mushroom style corn often has more chew to it than the lighter starburst or regular style, but this seemed more than usual.    I will say that, unlike some of the reviews I read, I found that most of the kernels were, indeed, mushroom style popcorn rather than starburst. Unfortunately, that hardly makes up for the poor popping performance and undesirable texture. My search for mushroom popcorn will go on.",0

B07DFMWF37,2018-08-20,AFMGQJQMTXFAZIRAQPUNFNIDMVWQ,Greg Palen,4.0,Great popcorn and loved the selections,  The most notable thing about this popcorn is just how much better it is than store-bought. It tastes better and pops far more completely (very few un-popped kernels). It was also great to be able to try so many different varieties of popcorn in this sample pack. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that the individual bags of popcorn need to be labeled as to what variety they are. As you go use the individual packages you have to be careful to keep the remaining packs in place else you will not be able to identify the variety (the labeling is all on the outer box).,0

Unfortunately, the popcorn packaging (a flimsy plastic box with interlocking tabs) is completely insufficient to holding a fairly heavy amount of popcorn seeds, so the bags were all over the inside of the bubble envelop and the box was crushed from the mail. I had to put them back in the box and tape it up for it to be sturdy enough to wrap as a gift.

Luckily the bags held in tact and no popcorn was lost in the process. Thankfully each one was labelled with the type of popcorn it was in the back of each pack so I was able to re-organize them back into the gift box.

The other two types produce a tiny baby popcorn kernel with, and they are correct, hardly any hull. No gritty bits in your gums. I would recommend with the smaller ones, if using one of those microwave popcorn bowls, not to microwave for longer than 1 minute 30 seconds. Take out what has popped and pop the rest.

I just don't tolerate them. The kernels very small so they, of course, produce smaller pieces of popped corn, which is fine with me. I am eating more popcorn now, as I enjoy it more.

Seeds pop up to crisp, delicate, little kernels. The flavor is delicious and the texture is fantastic!

I finally got her to stop eating microwave corn and was looking for a good popper. Well the popper is great and with this corn in it, it is amazing. I have never had gourmet popping corn and was disappointed with how small the kernels looked, but after popping the tender white I didn't care what size they were.

Just a little salt and it's a tender treat with very few hulls or duds.",0

As someone who seems to regret eating popcorn after the fact due to kernels either buried in gums or stuck in the throat this popcorn has been fantastic.

That simply isn't true and Amish Country Popcorn is delicious, light, and with a terrific chew. Unfortunately, because the kernels are so tiny, they aren't heavy enough to stay weighted down in the hot air popper until they pop. When you turn on the popper, they fly out! In order to pop them, I have to hold my air popper, with two hands, at a backward, sideways angle until the chamber starts filling up with popped corn. It's a work-around but not really a good one. I'm really bummed about it because the taste is as great as they claim.",0

The kernels are definitely smaller than Orville's bought in the supermarket but doesn't bother me. The smaller kernels do not work well in the air popper (the hot air tosses the kernels out before the can pop) so we use the Nordic Ware microwave popper. Every microwave varies, if I leave mine on for more than 2 minutes the popcorn begins to burn so as a result not all the kernels pop. I just put fewer kernels in the popper and it works fine.

I admit that I had high expectations of this product, having eaten wonderful Amish popcorn my uncle sent to me from Michigan. I think that the disappointment over the flavor and texture of these three products was due to their exposure to the air, since the bags they are sent in are not vacuum-sealed, but merely shut with twist-ties. In fact, the tie on the bag of purple popcorn was on very loosely, and the texture of the popcorn when popped was rather chewy.    Of course, don't believe any claim of ""hull-less"" kernels, that's not possible. These did pop up with a minimal hulls, and the flavor of the Ladyfinger was very nice. We make our popcorn in a Whirley-Pop, with a reasonable amount of oil over medium-high heat, as we have for years. So, unimpressed; but will manage to eat my way through the rest ;)",0

B001J3ZUQ6,2012-08-31,AFZQZBIDSNAXCCBQEDPGBH45QMRA,James Sidbury,4.0,Good Popcorn even in a hot air popper,"  Please take the numbers in this review with a pinch of salt (and maybe a little butter).    My pack came today. The directions said that a serving was 3 tablespoons, so I took one tablespoon of each of the three varieties and put them in my (very old) hot air popper and turned it on. It popped fine with only a few un-popped kernels and the number of old maids more numerous but also very small -- perhaps 1/3 of the number that I get with ""regular"" popcorn. The popped kernels are about half the size of regular popcorn when popped, but the that's to be expected since they are about 1/2 the size when it starts out. The flavor of all three varieties is good and I could tell that there were at least two different varieties based on the taste. I could not distinguish between the three varieties visually (but I didn't do a careful inspection, I just grabbed a handful and glanced at it as I was putting it in my mouth. I used about half a tablespoon of melted (real) butter and a decent size pinch of salt. I thought the three tablespoon serving was reasonable, perhaps not as much as I usually eat by volume but probably slightly more than I usually eat in terms of number of kernels. I'll try some tomorrow popped in oil and post an edit to this review.    In summary, it's a touch pricy for popcorn, but the flavor is slightly different from grocery store popcorn and I'd buy it again (especially with free (Prime) shipping).    EDIT: I have since tried this popcorn in a pot on the stove with oil (since the only poppers I have are hot air). I used corn oil since I thought it would be best with popcorn. Bottom line: I prefer it popped with hot air. Since buying a hot air popper a very long time ago, I've come to the conclusion that popcorn popped with oil (including microwave popcorn) has to much of a greasy taste to me. The exception is movie theater popcorn (which I know is popped with oil but somehow does not taste as greasy).",0

My husband and I love popcorn...the best of course is the movie theater type. That type of popcorn replicated at home can be too salty or too much of everything. It should be saved for special occasion such as being at the theater or use the special Theater style pouch for the Whirly Popcorn stove top. Now back to the Amish Country Popcorn....These 3 popcorn bags are a wonderful mix of small but delicate popcorn. My husband is use to the ""Bigger is Better"" in popcorn. All three pop up tender with smaller than average hull (teeth and gum wise better). All pop up fast, like an explosion in my stove top pot. Very little to no un popped kernels (anything under 5 un popped kernels is good/depending on size of kernels. The first time he tasted it...he was very surprised how small they were. When I showed him the kernels...he understood the ""why"". Then he notice how tender it was and not chewy. I still use ""Pop Secret"" large white kernels and Orville R. yellow popcorn but for a change of pace...I pop these...I think it's worth it. Lady finger is cute in size and looks. The midnight blue/purple pops up very neon white with tiny flecks of the hull. Baby white is also on the small size adorable comes to mind. So far I have purchased more of the Midnight blue/purple and I vacuum sealed them with the ""Food Saver"" bags. This is my only complaint with this company....they really should vacuum seal their popcorn...which prevents moisture lost.  I use 1 Tablespoon of cold pressed coconut oil, 1 Tablespoon of rice bran oil or 2 Tablespoon of Orville R. butter oil (Who said it has to be healthy!)......All a matter of taste to each person. Light on the Fine granules salt.  The next adventure will be Mushroom popcorn....this is the biggest popping kernel on the market for home popcorn poppers...you usually find them for Kettle Corn popcorn. Shall write on that one when I open it for the next adventure.  So open yourself up to trying something different. Yes, they are small but please Have FUN with eating popcorn!  ENJOY!

The current price on Amazon is $16.24 and that is ridiculous for three one pound bags of popcorn. My order was much less, but still way overpriced for the product. When popped, the kernals are quite small so you do not get as many ""poppings"" from a 1 pound bag as you would with larger popcorn. I get much better, larger popped corn, and just as ""hull-less"" from a bag of $1.88 WalMart Equate corn. The advertising suggests three distinct flavors, but it all tasted the same to me. I use a Whirly Pop which makes fantastic popcorn. I am sure the company is a good company and their shipping was fast and well packaged, I just think the product is not worth anywhere near the price. I was not going to leave a review on this product because I don't like to be negative, but they sent me an email and asked me to.",0

I'm not sure if the purple one is supposed to taste kind of like dirt, but it did. All three seemed to be either old or not properly stored. They all came in loosely secured plastic bags with twist ties. I popped each of them separately and found myself feeling like I was chewing on mold more than once. I would definitely not purchase this again or recommend it to others.    I bought these as a less expensive option to the smaller Pipcorn I found which doesn't have much hull at all and is incredibly tasty. These are not close to the same. While the kernels are similarly sized to the Pipcorn, the flavor and hulls are completely different. All of the Amish Country Popcorn kernels I tried had plenty of hull to them. It was not quite as bad as regular popcorn and enough to be a nuisance. Pipcorn is stupid expensive but flavorful and all but eliminates the hull problem of other popped corn.

Their third verity here the 'Purple' has no significant different taste or flavor than yellow or white popcorn.  Popcorn is popcorn after being popped.  Also save your money on their caramel topping. You are just buying brown sugar.  They are charging ($11.58) for a 10 oz. jar of what amounts to brown sugar.  A 2 lb. bag of brown sugar is around $2.00 at your local grocery store.

B001J3ZUQ6,2016-05-06,AFIQEMMA4JBNU67QLMMKJFUEXDMA,Summerlover97,5.0,Very good Popcorn.,"  I have been looking all over for this popcorn!! I was willing to drive back up to the North Georgia Mountains to purchase more of this popcorn, so it has to be good in order for me to want to make a 168 mile trip to get it. Now I don't have to because we can get it through Amazon.    Let me start out by saying I have never been a huge popcorn fan. It's okay, but nothing I ever looked forward to. I might have a few tastes of it but it wasn't something I looked forward to; until trying this. We purchased a bag of the white, the purple/blue and the red. All three of them are slightly different and all very good. I wouldn't consider them to be hulless like they claim but they are no where near the gum damaging stuff that one normally gets. The kernels pop up smaller, but pack more of a flavor punch. Absolutely no more microwave stuff, theater stuff, etc. We went back to pan frying the stuff and loved it!! It is the snack of choice in our house. We did purchase a popcorn maker and it works great there too, and makes more than a fry pan's worth, which is the reason we purchased it. However, for lunches, I have put a small amount of oil over kernels in a paper lunch sack, stapled it closed and microwaved it until it stops popping (there are recipes for this on the internet)    My goal is to get everyone off of the chemical microwave stuff and turned on to this stuff. We had run out of this and purchased both the major types of store brands in the bags and jars, but again are dealing with the gum damaging huge hulls; the flavor also isn't the same. For those who are worried about how long this will keep, we purchased a lot back when we first found it and kept it in canning jars, and it kept just fine for a couple of years, in a cool dark cabinet.",0
B001J3ZUQ6,2017-05-30,AEXZ2K3XK7VTKB5G7X7KQMFSDZBA,Crusader,5.0,Bestest unpopped popcorn on earth!,"  This popcorn rocks, for many reasons.    I am a huge lover of popcorn, but my dentist frowns on it because hulls often get stuck in teeth and that can cause perio problems if not moved in a reasonable period of time with floss and brushing!    Anyhow, Deep River stopped making my favourite pre-popped baby white cheddar cheese popcorn, and nothing else compared. So I decided I would pop my own.    I was aware that the smaller the kernel, the better-tasting the popcorn will be and fewer hulls, which is important. This three-pack variety is the perfect way to try this excellent popcorn.    I loved all three flavours and someone else reviewed that the purple kernels had an interesting taste, and it does. The smallest kernel I believe is lady finger and that produced the least amount (if any) hulls, so that is important to note.    Enjoy!",0
B001J3ZUQ6,2012-06-15,AHRRHVYAMGOVJR53O2X6DAO6SZQA,JaxRox,5.0,Tried the all & here's my advice,"  I got the combo starter pack. Flavor is good with all of the varieties, but they have their pros and cons. Baby White are very tiny and a bit hard to eat with fingers, so I ended up using a big spoon to eat (also too many unpopped kernels). Gourmet red IS less hulls, but a bit larger than Baby White, but still too small for my tastes, but it DOES have great flavor. Gourmet White medium is an excellent choice, pops well, crunchy, flavorful, easy to pick up. My Favorite is Purple Popcorn with good sized kernels, nutty flavor almost, tender, perfection and looks good in the bowl (not that it matters). All of their popcorn is grown so much better than conventional popcorn - no doubt due to their old-fashioned ways of farming.... thank you Amish Community for being this way. No more Jolly Time or Orville's for me. My only negative review is that glass corn popper device they sell, does not work well in microwaves... too many un-popped kernels and if you put too much it'll burn real easy and ya end up with a very stinky microwave and kitchen UGH! IF they know how to make it work, give very detailed instructions or discontinue.",0

I usually have no problem, following Jolly Time's club instructions, making fluffy, crisp, fully popped kernels. With Amish Country, I get chewy (even leathery), unpopped corn that doesn't taste fresh at all. I am sorely disappointed in this product and don't recommend it to anyone.    FYI: Jolly Time recommends placing a kernel in hot oil over medium heat and waiting for it to pop to indicate the oil's readiness to add the rest, as it's at popping temperature. They also suggest 1/2 cup of kernels per standard 3-quart stovetop pan and 2-3 tbls oil, with salt to taste.",0

Meaty with barely any hull. Ladyfinger is good too. I mixed it with the purple so the purple would last longer. I'm not a fan of the baby white.

Popcorn is very tasty with a smooth texture. I didn't find any hard parts in the popped corn as I have in others. Chomp away with pleasure. Note that it is medium - not huge puffs of white fluff here. I use an air popper and there were only a couple of unpopped kernels. Excellent snack for hand-to-mouth disorder. Yum!,0
B00M9NLJWO,2018-08-26,AEAIAY4QCNLWJTXUPQENI7D3RKIA,TMS,5.0,almost hulless less chockage on popcorn lol,  it works beatifully either in the pan with just a little bit of oil (olive oil) is best - but I prefer to add 3/4 cup in a plain brown paper bag and fold it up with the folds facing up and put the microwave on 3 minutes - you may need to adjust the microwave per the wattage or you could burn the popcorn and the bahg - I also recomend sitting on a piece of paper towel in the micrwave - it cooks a full back of perfect popcorn and you can make any amount you want and save a lot of money buying the microwave popcorn - also I go to dollar tree and buy their lunch paper bags 40 of them for 1$1 you cant beat that 11,0

The popcorn kernels have a pale yellow color, which should have served as an indicator that trouble was ahead. The popcorn is flat and stale, even after preparing it in a variety of different ways.

I removed it from the bag thinking it was just the bag and put the popcorn in a plastic container. The next day, the container and popcorn reeked of dryer sheet. I was afraid if I put the popcorn in my silicone microwave popper that the smell would also impart to the popper. And, it probably tasted just like a dryer sheet too. I assume they must store this popcorn with dryer sheets for some odd reason. Had to trash it and that's my money down the drain.",0
B00M9NLJWO,2018-07-21,AGJE66UAC4QQTDJQXAUBJFHDFGJQ,A . Cain,3.0,Good Popcorn for a Kettle bad for Air Poppers,"  The rating on this popcorn depends on the method used to pop it. This is a small, light kernel. It works pretty well in a kettle or a sealed electric popper. It has good flavor and reasonable texture. Do not use this in a Air Popper unless you want to see a lot of unpopped kernels blow out of the front of the popper. If you are using a Air popper I would recommend a large kernel popcorn, such as Great Northern, or Orville Rickenbacker which seems to works well in Air poppers.",0
B00M9NLJWO,2018-08-26,AFLQPHH3FQYTFBY47MASRJJQGD2Q,Janice,1.0,Not what I expected,"  I expected fewer hulls. Since the kernels are small the hulls are too but the proportion is the same; you just get smaller popcorn with smaller hulls. In my opinion, that's even worse. I rarely throw anything away, I can usually force myself to eat things that don't meet my expectations, but In this case, I will probably toss it.",0

For people who have air poppers, like myself, this is simply a no-brainer for me. The popcorn is all uniform white popcorn and it has a great texture (light and airy, not dense and chewy).

There are soo many different types and colors and most all of them are great.

This is medium size white because we use it in hot air popper, which it works fine in. However, a very small kernel doesn't work as well in hot air poppers (type I have at least)....  This popcorn only leaves 2 or 3 unpopped and eats easily. Nice big white kernels. We had bought some from Earth Fare a couple weeks ago and HULLS galore!! (was bought 'per pound' out of container) Glad we only got one pound of that! This is MUCH better!  We add just the amount of salt and real butter dripping over it that we want, sometimes using a different spice as well.... (chili powder, or dill weed, lime seasoning, etc...)  I don't have to spit hardly any out- there are a few sharp hulls that still appear in my mouth however, therefore- Less-hulls, not Hull-less. If you want a melt in the mouth hull-less for microwave, I found ""skinny girl"" fits that bill....and although low fat, still has other oils, etc... that I don't want to put in my body on regular basis.",0

It's also non GMO. And although it's a bit smaller than regular popcorn, it pops well in my hot air popcorn maker. A few kernels blow out before popped, but that's to be expected with the hot air popper. We love this corn and it will last us awhile, as it is a 6 lb bag! yeah! I suggest you keep in the freezer to keep fresh. The pantry moths started making their way to it, and I caught it before they infested into it- and put the bag in freezer. Pops up very well, doesn't burn in my hot air popper, and only just a couple/few don't pop. It's GREAT! And tasty- yummy!    October 2017 UPDATE:  There are about 10 kernels that blow out of the hot air popper. Sometimes, I throw the first few back in (before they get too hot). But most of them pop. I pour several cups into a glass canister with tight lid. The rest I keep in the freezer until needed. This keeps the 6 lb bag fresher. It is definitely NOT hulless. I don't notice it so much when i'm stuffing my mouth, but on that last bite- when I've had plenty, I find there is a lot of debris that I still have in my mouth- so it's swish swish in the bathroom. Extremely good while eating though. And the hulls are not big like many brands,. Love that it's non GMO! I still give them a 5 star until I find something better.",1

These kernels make the popcorn taste extremely fresh even when I make it in the morning and don't eat it until night. Highly recommend it. High in fiber and protein too! A great snack!",0
B00GO6GUIU,2018-02-06,AHWQTEPY74ZLL4C2WATS77MKKNZQ,Chris,1.0,Very Bad Experience,  This review is only on the the Red Popcorn. I have never encountered problems with Popcorn like this before. The problems were caused by the fact that so many of the kernels would not pop. My 1st problem happened when I tried popping the popcorn in my hot air popcorn popper. Because so many kernels would not pop they burnt and over heated in my popper. This filled the room with some smoke and shut the popper down. Next I tried to pop the popcorn in my microwave. I put the kernels in a plastic microwave safe bowl. Because so many of the kernels would not pop no matter how long I popped them they became so hot that they melted into the plastic ruining the bowl. At that point the popcorn was put in the trash because I didn't want to take the chance of burning down my Condo.  I may have gotten a bad batch of popcorn and I'm surprised this hasn't happened to other people.,0

The popcorn was great, but 15 ounces is not 16 ounces, I don't care where you live (and one bag was 14 ounces). We ordered it around Christmas, so maybe they were stretching their supply to fill orders? I don't know. Its still a good product at a good price, I just don't like dishonest labeling practices.",0
B00GO6GUIU,2015-02-25,AFQYGKWOHXRK3JAF7U5H2SC4EHNA,Tammie,5.0,"great corn, great variety, great value!!!","  Great popcorn variety!! Just for reference, one pound is approx a sandwich bags worth.    The purple corn pops yellow and white kernels with a taste similar to standard popcorn. It is fluffy with very little crunch.    The blue corn has a sweet taste and mild popcorn flavor(too sweet for me, but hubby and the kids love it). Fluffy corn with a small amount of crunch.    The lady finger is a family favorite, mildly sweet, rich popcorn taste. It is a small, hullless, crunchy kernel(no choking hazard for my 2yr old-yeah!) with a big taste. There seem to be mixed reviews on this corn however, so I experimented a bit, when served to those that like those half popped kernels love this corn, those that do not touch anything that didnt pop perfectly dont like it as much(its too crunchy for them). So this is a love it or hate it corn(typically).    We pop in a whirly pop and RARELY have unpopped/half popped kernels with any of these corns.    Happy popping!!!",0
B00GO6GUIU,2018-03-22,AGA5AGX74KBW6SACUZMDVCCPYTJA,Hummingbirds,3.0,I would say the blue is about the best out of all 3,"  We are sort of popcorn conniseurs. For the past 6-7 years, I've made a batch of popcorn nearly every night before bed, as we sit down to watch TV. We've tried many brands. This Amish Country popcorn tastes ok. I would say the blue is about the best out of all 3. But we found they all had a lot of tough hulls, and did not pop up very large or fluffy at all. It also left a lot unpopped (old maids). We went back to our old brand of Bobs, which was fluffier and larger. I probably would not try these again.",0

If you want big fluffy popcorn this is not the stuff. The kernels are small and I got a lot of un-popped ones any time I made it. Methods used were a stainless pot on stove top and paper bag microwave method. After getting through this I bought Jiffy and another brand of jumbo popcorn from grocery store and it was way better. Also there were some kernels that were either rotten or just not good. Im going to guess with heirloom corn this is a regular occurrence. I won't be ordering again, we really like the jumbo stuff thats cheaper.",0
B00GO6GUIU,2017-01-07,AEIXGFFJYEQFVGBUGCKOQCAJRQRQ,nobody really,5.0,Amish Country Popcorn,"  This popcorn is excellent!! We like the red the best. It has a very crisp texture and it has a great taste. I think the blue may have a better flavor than red, and Its texture is good too, but my family prefers the red over all. All of these taste and pop SO much better than any grocery store popcorn.Every kernel popped. Our experience is with a whirley popper. We like to use coconut oil. Then we add variety to the popped corn~sometimes just some salt, usually I like to add Nutritional Yeast flakes for added protein and vitamins~It makes great kettle corn too with coconut oil and turbinado sugar. I highly recommend. I do not receive any added benefits for writing this review. I had to pay the full price and think it is worth the extra cost.",0
B00GO6GUIU,2017-08-31,AE4M62F4FXVZDCCBK373ALAGN2PA,Amazon_Customer,4.0,Packaging needs work but popcorn was great,"  They all tasted great in their own way, but the purple was my favorite. I made it using a West Bend Stir Crazy Popcorn Maker and olive oil, and wow...it tasted like movie popcorn! I love that it has fewer hulls and more antioxidants, and I couldn't believe how few unpopped kernels remain after popping - usually only 1-2, at most 3 little kernels. With store bought yellow corn, there would be 2 Tbsp would remain unpopped.    My only concern about the popcorn is the packaging - just a plastic bag with a twist tie, no seals of any kind. There's no protection for the food, which sits in a warehouse environment until shipped. That really shocks me that this packaging is FDA approved. It makes me wonder if the seller purchased it in bulk, and then repackaged it?",0

I felt a few hulls in my mouth but no hulls stuck to my teeth! The popcorn is very tasty. It only made half the volume of popped popcorn from the same amount of kernels of Orville Redinbacher Popcorn, but, eww, the hulls, so many hulls!  I made it in the Westbend Stircrazy Popcorn Maker, which I also highly recommend. West Bend 82505 Stir Crazy Electric Hot Oil Popcorn Popper Machine with Stirring Rod Offers Large Lid for Serving Bowl and Convenient Storage, 6-quart, Red  I cooked the popcorn in ghee, which is a form of clarified butter. It has all the water and milk solids cooked out so you can use high heat without burning and get the butter flavor without the popcorn getting soggy or scorched.

We enjoyed it and decided to get some more. We use only a hot-air popper and put nothing on the popped kernels. The un-popped corn looks the same as what we purchased previously, but the popped kernels of this red corn are much larger than the other and taste even better in our opinion. We've not yet tried the other two flavors. I am very happy with this corn and will come back for more!    Another review described some bad corns in what they purchased. We saw no evidence of this in our purchase.",0

Using both hot air popper and stovetop methods for cooking brought mediocre results. Lots of residue and hulls, small volume, and a multitude of unpopped kernels. None of the colors popped as completely or as puffed as the store brands I purchased in the past.  In fact, I actually switched to a smaller bowl when using the hot air popper - the volume is that poor.  The flavor is fine, but I wouldn't recommend these unless you are a person who likes the crunchy bits in the bottom of the bowl.",0

(If you too have a corn allergy I would recommend doing a small test before diving in, just in case.) This popcorn tastes wonderful. So far I have only tasted blue and purple and they are great! I've used an airpopper and made some on the stove top. I prefer the air popper and pour melted butter on afterwards with some salt. For the stove top the first time I used olive oil and it was too oily for me. (I used one tablespoon of oil and 4 tablespoons of kernels. The bag recommends one to three or more ratio.) I found using butter with the same ratio tastes better to me, but I still add a touch of oil to help the butter, since butter has such a low burning point.    I would definitely recommend this to everyone.",0

I saw some reviews about unpeopled kernels. It could have been old corn but a few mentioned they used air poppers. It's no longer the 80s so there's no reason to pop your corn via a hairdryer connected to a tunnel. Enjoy life and use a pot with oil. Better yet get a zippy popcorn pot because those are fantastic.,0

WE have been buying the crimson red for years so I thought we might be biased. But it wasnt so  No real duds but  #1 Purple had the best combination of taste and flavor. A more delicate texture  #2 Crimson red a close second to the Purple. Just a bit more of a husk feeling.  #3 Blue was not bad but seem to have bit of an off flavor.,0

Just enough oil to cover the popcorn. Once the oil is heated up, put the popcorn in there. it will immediately begin to sizzle. The heat has to be at a medium. Once it all pops, pour in in a bowl, and put some sugar, and salt to taste. Another thing to do, is wait for the oil to be very hot, then add the sugar to the oil the do the popcorn like I said. This popcorn is very tasty.",0

UPDATE: I've tried the red and blue now. Both are excellent.    The red is less flavorful, still good, but not anything to write home about. The texture, however, is flawless as far as i'm concerned. No real hulls, crispy with no chewiness, light and crunchy but not the least bit rough on the mouth. A couple half-popped duds, nothing unpopped.    The blue is similar to the purple, but less spectacular and more of a light sweet flavor than the intense corn flavor of the purple. 1 unpopped kernel, a dozen or so partially popped, but they were still edible with their own tasty character.    All three are terrifically enjoyable. I'd buy them again in the future. Not the end all be all popcorn, but a solid 4.5/5.",0

Like many reviewers said; it is all true for me as well: Tiny popcorn, some have a lot of hull (even though it says: ""less hull."" We only really liked the BLUE. It popped nicely (stove top) and it did have less hull. The purple batch - I ended up throwing almost everything out - the next day. Extremely small; hulls; too many unpopped kernels. Got mushy very quickly. The red batch, was the same thing - but it popped more than the purple. Tons of hull on the red: and it says ""less hull.""  The same company sells a white (hulless) - 6lbs, for almost $14... But, at this point, I am not sure if I believe it is really 'hull-less,' as promised.  I make popcorn (stove top and/or air popper) 4-5 times a week. Not happy with these guys here - except for the Blue - which was my favorite. But still, extremely expensive for popcorn... If they cost a bit more, that is okay - but these little guys here are way OVERPRICED! Mainly if you are having a party, have a big family, or eat a lot of it in one sitting - like me. And you have to throw more then half in the trash because they are either: unpopped, have too much hull - for their little sizes, or get mushy super fast.  Of course, do not expect huge popcorn - because this is a different type of kernels. I used almost an entire bag (1 lb) and got less than half of your regular popcorn. If they were truly hull-less, and did not leave so many kernels - I would not have minded. Some people here also said they burn easily. Yes; they may. They are very delicate, and you will need to adjust your heat (if not using an air-popping machine) well, and remove from heat as soon as you hear the pop slowing down.",0

I can't speak for the speckled or the blue I am truly hoping better than the purple. I will write an update when I use the other. As it stands right now I will not order this combination ever again.,0

I wasn't sure that I wanted them small, though, I'd lean more toward the larger type... but I was pleasantly surprised. This has a nice nutty flavor. I used this in a air popper that I just got. I'm not so sold on that, either. I'm going to try this with oil, and a good old fashioned stove top pot. For the price, I wouldn't but this again - but if you are into popcorn I would definitely give this a try.",0

There is the aroma factor, the toothyness, the texture and color. I thought there were only three kinds, movie, jiffy and jollytime! My family loves popcorn so I thought I'd get them some different types to try. Let's see if they can tell the difference since they all pop up white. The popcorn arrived bundled together and well packed. Regardless of kernel size, you add the same amount. In other words, don't overload your popper. These work equally well on the stovetop, electric popper and air popper...yes, we tried all three methods. There are subtle differences in taste that can be distinguished if you eat them plain like my family. Once you add butter, all bets are off. They did mention that the hulls were better than Orville's since them don't seem to get caught between the teeth as much. Hate when that happens... Is it worth the price?

Because the kernels are small, they tend to more easily fly out of my air popper, but it hasn't been a major problem.

We prefer the hulless types, because there are no hulls to get caught in between teeth, gums and braces to cause irritation and additional dental hygiene issues! The purple variety is on of our favorites and on of the most flavorful, but they are all good. The colored varieties offer more antioxidants, and variety of texture and flavor than the traditional yellow and white varieties, so I feel they are even healthier for my family. We use a WestBend StirCrazy2 for popping and healthy fats like coconut oil, ghee and/or bacon fat (bacon fat is by far my families favorite!), and fine sea salt,",0

They are all great, and the colors here are fun to show guest and have them choose their favorite color. The down side, when friends come over I usually have to make a little of each, because they are all so good.

B00GO6GUIU,2015-07-08,AEHSMF7Y6CR6GPPLXF537AHGNPTQ,Mo,4.0,All three of the varieties included in this bundle pop up nice and there are very few hulls,"  It's a Wednesday night and, as you can probably guess, I don't have a lot to do. Hence this review of popcorn.    I can honestly say I've only tried a few non-grocery store bought popcorn varieties, so I can't claim significant knowledge. However, this is a repeat purchase for me. All three of the varieties included in this bundle pop up nice and there are very few hulls. Crisp and crunchy. A bit smaller in terms of the popcorn size, but I actually kind of like that.    As for the distinction between the varieties, I taste a bit more sweetness with the purple variety and have to say that is my favorite. The purple is perhaps slightly smaller when popped compared to the red and blue. However, in a blind taste test, I'm not sure I could distinguish one from the other. Why do I bother buying the variety pack? I don't know! Good question.    At any rate, I recommend. (My method is a stainless steel pot on a gas stove. I use grape seed oil and Penzeys Smoky 4/S sea salt for seasoning.)",0

Also, popping was rather uneven, lots of half-popped kernels and a fair number of old maids. The colors are a nice novelty, but ultimately it's all about flavor and texture, and we just found it rather bland.

Ignore the haters!,"  After reading the reviews, including the bad ones, I was determined to review as soon as it arrived so I made myself some right away. First the colors of the kernels were beautiful. There was some corn meal floating around the bag but otherwise it was very clean and pretty. I have a single serving air popper. I noticed immediately that the kernels were not flying around as the other organic/nongmo brands I used, signifying a firm, dense kernel. It took a tad bit longer before it began popping, makes sense for dense kernels. When they began popping it was like a show! Huge, gigantic popcorn with varied colors! Amazing! Almost all of it popped too, very little unpopped/half popped. The taste was unreal, so good. I only added a bit of salt as I prefer non greasy popcorn. Some of it was a bit more crunchy than others but, hey, we want nongmo because it’s natural and that means variety. Most of it was yummy crunchy. I know that the Amish work is quality and I was determined to review accordingly and I am not disappointed. I will be buying exclusively from them from now on. There is no better.

Firstly, the popcorn that is popped is way too small. I feel like I’m eating bits of fragmented popcorn instead of nice big fluffy popcorn. Secondly, the varying sizes of the kernels makes it difficult to actually pop the corn. I make my popcorn on the stove via a pot so the differing popping times leaves a lot of unpopped kernels.    As far as taste goes, I don’t get the ‘nutty’ flavor that people are referring to. Maybe I’m a simpleton but the Target pop corn kernels are -0x better in my humble opinion.",0

I have no issue with taste, texture or size of the kernel.  We cook this over the stove top. It takes way longer to pop because a lot of the kernels are duds, which means you kinda get a burnt flavor if you go longer to get them to pop. Also, maybe it's just my luck, but I always seem to grab a dud to test if the oil is hot enough for popping, which also makes it super easy to burn the popcorn.  I think the ""hull-less"" claim is a joke. Yes, I'm aware that there's always going to be a hull, but these are supposed to be softer. This product tears my mouth up worse than jolly-time. I have shells stuck all up in my mouth, it's like popcorn shrapnel.  I'm really disappointed with this product and I'm eating it as fast as I can so I can get some cheap stuff.

I always thought I was crazy when suddenly I would eat a handful and it tasted like grass or mold. In the last few orders it has happened more often and I have not been the only one to find the bad kernels. I do not know what they are doing wrong but there has been an excess of moldy batches of red corn. I still have one bag left and am scared to pop it because the last bag was so bad.  I have switched to the baby white for now,0
B003ZJQBLA,2017-07-14,AFOY22JPAPU2ADNAEWGIXNVYACLA,Queen Bee 🐝--------,5.0,OMG! This popcorn is dangerous you won't be able to stop eating it! Really delicious,"  Yummo! Warning! You'll eat the whole Bowl! Not your regular popcorn for sure!  Very tender smaller kernels pop up perfectly! I made my first batch on the stove top in a non-stick Dutch oven style pot. I followed the directions on the bag using one part oil and three parts kernels. I used Crisco vegetable oil, 1/4 cup, heated the pan, headed the kernels and a little bit of sea salt, maybe a teaspoon covered the pot and waited for the excitement to begin! Moved pan around a little bit so that nothing would burn. Turn the heat down just a little bit after it got Poppin pretty good. Once the popping slowed, I shut the heat off , still moving the pot around a little bit. Once the pot got quiet, I dumped it in a big bowl and added more sea salt to my liking! Oh my God! It's delicious and highly addictive! Definitely would recommend, it is a little bit on the pricey side, but it's sooo worth it! You do not need any fancy popcorn popper, and it does not work in an air popper, so do not use an air popper to make it! Hope you found the info helpful enjoy!!😙",0

I've found cheaper bags you can get for $1-2 barely pop.  I was thrilled to find this 6 POUND bag of kernels for around $10-11 here which was a HUGE savings but had never had ""red popcorn"" before. I have to tell you it's VERY good. Yes, the popped kernels are a little smaller but have a great taste to them. I would highly recommend buying a bag of these and look forward to ordering again!",0

You need to check out your popcorn before you sell any more. Now, I could have done something wrong. I throwed the bag away and put it in a container, so, I did not see any recipe guide.

B003ZJQBLA,2016-01-27,AFJUCDSJQSL6MM2JRKVGV3XCG6GQ,KittyMac,1.0,Like eating gravel,"  I think this might be the second time I've inflicted this stuff on myself. Ages ago I bought a small bag of Wabash brand, and loved it, and gobbled it up in a couple weeks. So then I think I should be buying larger bags & maybe something less costly and I look around & this stuff looks like a good deal so I get some. Then I made a bowl and found it inedible! But I wouldn't let myself throw it away... yet I didn't want to eat it... so it lurked in my cupboard for months. Every once in a while I'd forget why I stopped eating it and make another bowl. Finally I used it up and got to buy the good kind again! But after I inhaled another bag of Wabash, I got on a ""corn is bad for you"" kick and time passed... I forgot which type I liked. Which brings us to now. I decided to try the cheaper stuff. The cycle repeats.  What's so different about the two? Well obviously the dominant taste is always corn, but as for the subtler tastes that make the  ""personality"" of each brand... the Wabash has a nuttiness, whereas this stuff has a hint of corn husk/silk/cob, you know what I mean? Also, about a third of the kernels failed to open (with Wabash over 95% open, by my experience). And of those that did, most still contained unpopped parts that were hard as rock! Frankly it was unpleasant to chew and to taste. If I'm gonna disrespect my health with a bowl of salt and butter drenched popcorn, the experience had better at least be enjoyable!",0

The kernels pop up small and crispy; the hulls are thinner so they are easier to digest and don't stick in your teeth as much. The taste is the thing: delicate and toasty just with a little canola oil and salt. The best way to prepare? With a Whirlypop stove top popcorn maker - well worth the extra effort and expense of ordering your popcorn online and paying for shipping - unless you buy enough in bulk and get free shipping (but never put your popcorn in the freezer, you'll ruin it). Store in perhaps separate air tight containers and you'll be good for a while. If you eat popcorn like me, it won't take you long to go through this.......",0

Let's face it, lots of varieties are just a vehicle to get more butter and salt in your mouth! It is a smaller variety, so if you're air popping, it'll pop best if you use the maximum amount for your popper, and you might want to tilt the popper back until a bunch of it has popped, or you might have a bowl full of kernels that flew out before they popped.

I don't feel like I need to floss the whole time while eating it. It is tender, nutty and very easy to eat/scarf the entire bucket. I usually use an Orville Redenbacher PowerPop Presto microwave popper with olive or coconut oil. Sometimes I use a stove top Whirly-Pop with the same great results. On average, there are about 5-10 Old Maids. No big deal. I know better than to get greedy and try for zero Old Maids because there is a fine line between perfect and burnt. I add Kettle Corn or other powdered flavor seasonings and toss with butter flavored oil topping from Orville Redenbacher.",0

Have also tried about every oil known to man, corn, Mazola, safflower, peanut, olive, sesame, cotton seed, sun flower..., and for past several years settled on grape seed as best for taste and popping efficiency. I've worn out several poppers since their inception. Before that used a stainless steel pot on the stove.    So back to the Red Amish Country Popcorn. Every last kernel popped. A tribute to the product and the Presto popper when the popping commenced in short order explosive fashion it was over popped to the last kernel. The popped corn is bright white and relatively small. Consistency is perfect, soft enough while retaining the ""crunch"" vital to a pleasurable experience. Some corn has harsh, sharp, distasteful, difficult to deal with in mouth - residual husks. Not this corn virtually no remaining husk after chewing. I can't stand the large yellow popping corn originally purveyed on TV by its grower a white haired gentleman until his death in 1995. It has passed through a plethora if corporate owners since sold by two partner original owners starting with Hunt-Wesson. Only the uninitiated consume this stuff.",0
B00VJMJZ1I,2017-12-06,AHM2365YG5Z47L4DBC5JIJWTEK2Q,Brewingbiker,5.0,This is good stuff!,"  I use this popcorn in my movie popcorn machine. Keep in mind two things: These are small kernels and white corn. This produces smaller popped corn and also fewer husks. This brand seems to produce fewer old maids (unpopped kernels) and is very flavorful. My wife and I both prefer this brand over the others we have tried (and we have tried a lot of them. Never had 'bad' ones, but this one seems better than the others). It comes just as pictured -in a large bag.",0
B00VJMJZ1I,2017-12-05,AFNVJZU2UPNQ6NURINIJPOGREVNQ,Ronald D. Ellermeier,5.0,This popcorn is good enough to buy again,"  I'm reviewing a repeat order. This popcorn is good enough to buy again. It is very tender, has a minimum of hulls and pops completely. In general, yellow popcorn has more flavor, but with heavy, sometimes sharp hulls. White popcorn has a little less ""corn"" flavor, but is far more tender with fewer hulls. Whether any popcorn pops well or not is a function of how well the farmer and the processor treat and care for the grain. It must not have cracks and scratches in the pericarp and must be at about 14% moisture. Popcorn should be sealed at home so it doesn't dry below 14%, or you will get lots of ""old maids"". It seems to us that the producers and processors of this popcorn are doing a pretty good job.",0

I usually pick my popcorn pieces apart, picking out hulls, as I just don't like to chew or swallow them.

B00VJMJZ1I,2017-09-11,AEICMK5V6C6R7765E5CYJTDWGTLQ,Maryilee,5.0,Best popcorn ever!,"  So crunchy and light! I actually bought my first bag of this at a sort of local store, so when I ran out, I had to replace it asap. The store is about 30 min from me, so instead, I looked up the product on Amazon and ordered it. The price was so much cheaper when I factor in the amount I received. This bag is BIG!    Okay, so here's the secret to the best popcorn ever. I heat up my pot on the stove, melt coconut oil in it--enough so that the popcorn, when added, is in a little puddle of it, but not drowning, but before you add the popcorn, put about a teaspoon or so of FlavacolGold Medal Prod. 2045 Flavacol Seasoning Popcorn Salt 35oz. in the bottom and swirl it through the oil. This will give a little buttery flavor and salt, plus a nice color. It makes it the movie theater color, depending on how much you use. Add the desired amount of popcorn. These are little kernels but almost all of them pop, so keep that in mind. I think my pot is 6 quarts, and I use about a half cup of the kernels to get 3/4 of the pot. Cover, but leave a little opening where the top isn't quite covering the pot to allow steam to escape. When enough of the popcorn has popped that it isn't pinging on the lid, you can even take the top off altogether and the popcorn on top keeps the stuff underneath from popping out, but that's only the last 30 seconds or so. It lets a lot of the steam out that can make popcorn less crunchy. The picture of after popping of a half cup of kernels. Diet Coke bottle is for size reference.    For extra butter flavor, melt the desired amount of butter in a measuring cup in the microwave. Let it sit for a moment to separate. Using a spoon, skim off the clear yellow part--this is clarified butter-- and use only that part to drizzle over the popcorn. The white stuff at the bottom of the cup is the milky stuff that can make popcorn soggy, so by just using the clear butter, you get this wonderful taste, no sogginess, and if you need to, you can sprinkle more salt on top (but taste first--the Flavacol is salty already)    Now I'm going to go make some because writing this review is making me hungry for it!",0
B00VJMJZ1I,2016-12-22,AGK2SNJLVPQ6AFCTSPKGJGP3BH3Q,R. DuMond,5.0,Go ahead. Drizzle some Ghiradelli on it,"  I'm sure a rated this before. Oh well... I love popcorn. But I won't eat bad popcorn. I eat popcorn the way cookie monster eats cookies: Ah umph, num nom nom. (not in public of course) I generally love very corny flavor with a few unpopped kernels just to keep my dentist employed.  So, what does the popcorn connoisseur think of Amish Country Baby White Hulless? It has its distinct flavor. It is very light and delicate. I have an air popper which works fine. When I pop this popcorn, there are very very few that don't pop and the ones that don't are about like corn nuts in consistency.  My spice cabinet is like the land of a thousand dances. I can drizzle olive oil, basil and garlic and voila Italian popcorn, or wasabi and soy for samurai dragons For this delicacy I recommend popping it in a dry heavy stainless steel pot, such as a pressure cooker without the lid, olive oil misted , with ground Himalayan sea salt and finely ground Parmesan.  Your imagination and this pop corn is a marriage made by Amazon and Amish Country! Abundanza!!!",0

A month and a half later, I am at the end of my two pound bag of popcorn, and I eat it alone! This is fantastic popcorn, and I eat a lot of popcorn.

Who knew there was really THAT different kinds of popcorn? I love popcorn but my dentist and my teeth, not so much! I'm so tired of cracking down on a kernel and being afraid of damage. But with these, there is very little of that. I won't say completely hard kernel free as you still have to watch for some unpopped ones in your bowl but much fewer and no more hard bits in the popped ones or stuck in your teeth afterwards.

The plastic bag had a small hole in the bottom where the popcorn leaked out! From the reviews I've read about this popcorn, it seems like it is tender & I'll try it tonight. I use to pop popcorn in olive oil, being it's healthier, but the popcorn always seemed tough! I wasn't sure if it was the olive oil or the popcorn! I now use Canola oil for popping it, as the popcorn seemed to be more tender. Last night (3-16-2018) I popped this Amish Country popcorn on my stove, hoping this would be the 5 star popcorn other people rated it at! I'll keep the 3 stars, as this popcorn I don't find it any better tasting or tender than the white popcorn I've previously bought at my grocery store for years. I'm 72 years old, going on 73 in May and this popcorn isn't any smaller than the average white popcorn I have bought at the grocery store! I don't like the larger kernel yellow popcorn as it's always more tough! I try to stay away from microwave popcorn, as I've read it isn't very healthy to eat, but it is a lot more tender than the stove top popcorn I've used. 3-25-2018... last night, I popped this Amish Country Popcorn again in a frying pan, but this time I used ORGANIC VIRGIN COCONUT OIL to pop it. I used about 4 Tbsp. to 2/3 cups of popcorn and dropped a couple kernels in the oil and waited until it popped, then added the rest of the popcorn. To my surprise, the popcorn was A LOT MORE TENDER than when I used Canola oil to pop it, so now I like this popcorn and have changed it to a 5 star! I also used equal portions of COCONUT oil and Smart Balance Buttery Spread melted to put on top of the popcorn. The next time I may just use Smart Balance to put on top, because the taste of the popcorn tasted a little too much like COCONUT OIL and was too greasy. Some people may like the COCONUT taste, but I thought it was a little too strong.",0

I took one look at these tiny, pale kernels of corn, not seeing the bright, large, yellow color I am used to and thought to myself ""Why, these kernels are nothing but some cheap carnival prizes for the gullible!"".    The corn protested little, saying nothing, but cajoling me to see for myself and it proved me wrong twice.  I took 1/3 cup into a large pasta pot with a few drizzles of olive oil to cover the bottom and set it to medium low, so as not to burn the surely delicate flowery things that I was certain would crumble under any pressure. Within 5 minutes, they practically popped in unison as easily as microwave popcorn except leaving jsut a few kernels behind.  Deciding to test them, I took another 1/3 cup with olive oil and this time turned the heat up to a medium high heat. Without any protest, burns marks, scalded husks or anything, they popped this time within 3 minutes leaving just as few brethren unpopped.    And there, the popcorn stood, in silent glory staring down my doubt and I was ashamed and yet delighted. =)    From there, the popcorn kernels took an honored stay in my kitchen.",0

I pop in the microwave. in a microwave popper I've had for years. I usually use 1Tbls salted coconut oil to 3 Tbls of popcorn kernels and pop on high setting for 4 minutes. With this Amish Counry Baby White, I had to give them another 4 minutes. Then I still had a few unpopped--less than 1Tbls. I ate the popped ones, then put the rest back in the Microwave for another 2 minutes and it popped almost all of them. So, although this takes more popping time, more kernels get popped than the Orvile Recenbacker white corn brand that I had been using ( 1 Tbls oil to 3 Tbls kernels) previously. Next time I think I'll give it 10 minutes on high.",0

My husband just loves this and he has been making a big bowl for himself every night. It smells great while it is popping, and pops cleanly and evenly. In other words, not a lot of hulls or old maids left. It's really hard for us to find baby white popcorn around our area, so I was thrilled to find this online for him.

I pop popcorn by setting the heat on my gas stove to medium or medium high and then drizzling a little olive oil in the bottom of a heavy pan with a lid. I add one kernel of popcorn and cover and wait until that kernel pops. When it does, I add enough popcorn to cover the bottom of the pan. I cover, shake, and let it cook until the popping slows down.

B00VJMJZ1I,2017-04-29,AGTZQFM4F2UTHBNZIRAXA4G2X2CA,Maurice Skillz,5.0,Pop pop pop don't stop!,"  Tried for the first time today in my West Bend 82310R Stir Crazy Deluxe popper. This corn is very tasty and the texture is hard to explain, but tender and crunchy at the same time. As others have mentioned, it pops up considerably smaller than other standard store bought popcorn kernels. Normally, I would get about 4 qts. popped corn from a half-cup of kernels. However, with this baby white Amish popcorn, I probably only got about 2.5 qts. from a half-cup (and I didn't notice one un-popped kernel). Despite the lesser volume of popped corn, I think I still prefer it over other standard corn. I feel like there were only slightly fewer hulls than normal, but they are much softer and resulted in far fewer hulls stuck in my teeth. I loved that! I did wind up burning it just a tad, but I think that was more of a function of using my new popper for the first time. With this popper, I think I need to turn off the heat and remove the popcorn before the popping totally stops. Very happy with this purchase.",0

Used my air popper & it came out superb.  You have to tilt the air popper until the unit heats up & the kernels start popping; otherwise the kernels will fly right out & make a mess.  Once heated, you can stand the air popper upright & let the dee-licios popcorn fill up your bowl. Very few kernels get in your teeth; unlike  the regular popping corn. This is my new found friend. :). I am so glad I tried this out, because I sure was missing my popcorn, but not the  large kernels getting wedged in my teeth. Also, love the two Day Prime s/h.

Bradford,5.0,Superior Popcorn Overcomes Cost,"  So this last order actually cost five thousand dollars (some fool cracked a molar on a ""knew it was there"" old maid, whoops) but as this is the best popcorn on Amazon, it still gets five stars! Small kernels, great flavor, somewhat dense post-pop, this isn't rock-bottom cheap, but the added expense is worth it in your average air-popper. I suppose the Amish frown on that, but I like mine. With kids, this is more of a feature than a problem, but if you do make a big air-popped bowl, a couple of kernels might ""dive bomb"" their family near the end (defined: an unpopped but ""almost!"" kernel lands in the bowl, then explodes). I want to say something mean because I hate visiting dentists, but there's really nothing to say. Okay, fine, the bag is nothing special, so transferring to Tupperware for storage is not a bad idea to avoid rips and tears. But it's still 5/5!",0
B00VJMJZ1I,2017-02-19,AGKEBE3IICIKA4YA3367AZXXEHTQ,Phoenix,3.0,Truth- It's Popcorn | False- It's Hulless,"  It's not hulless. The only reason I bought it was because I thought I'd finally be able to avoid eating popcorn and getting hulls stuck between my teeth and the long minutes of trying to flush it out with water, floss, etc. In fact this popcorn has the same hulls as normal popcorn does. Only difference is that this stuff gives you smaller popped corn. Before this I bought a jug of orville and I wish I was eating that instead. I pop using the West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy Electric Popcorn Popper. (Used a Whirly Pop over my stove before it. GET ONE! THEY ARE GOD SEND I SWEAR.)    At least it was actually popcorn. They didn't lie about that.    The hunt for actually hulless popcorn continues.    PS Lots of these white flaky dandruff looking things that kinda float around whenever you handle this stuff :[. Got a nice large puff of it in my nose. Hold your breathe when handling.    Edit - Just learned that hulless popcorn is impossible since the kernel itself is a hull. So my dreams are broken and god is dead thanks for reading.",0

This is the old fashioned popcorn we used to get when we were kids and is non GMO, etc. But the best part about this popcorn is it doesn't bother me and I have a lot of allergies. I picked up this healthy tip from my daughter who is in the military. I pop in microwave popper with no oil or anything and then drizzle melted coconut oil on and a little salt and eat it every single night for a healthy snack. I love to have something to munch on when its TV time and this keeps me from binge eating. I have done this for several years and I have not gained any weight at all from eating it this way and I eat quite a lot:-)",0
B00VJMJZ1I,2016-05-08,AHRRWGP4NG7NJVQXNQOQL4BPKQ6A,Sarah,4.0,"Great tasting popcorn, but be cautious if you have jaw issues (TMJ)","  I bought this popcorn hoping it wouldn't aggravate my TMJ. I had bought a hulless brand of popcorn in the past, but couldn't find it so I thought I'd give this a chance. I pop about three tablespoons in a brown paper bag in the microwave for about minute and a half. As others have commented, the kernels pop wonderfully, they're small, don't burn easily, and taste great! The downsides are that there are more hulls than I expected and since they're so small, they're actually a little dense which requires more chewing, which in turn aggravates my jaw a little (but no where near as much as regular popcorn does). Having said all of this, the taste of this popcorn is far superior to anything I could get at the grocery store so I keep eating this and just deal with the jaw pain. I probably can't eat this daily, but that's all right with me. Everyone else loves the taste and eats it without any jaw pain. I'll keep buying it for others and keep looking for something else for myself.",0

B00VJMJZ1I,2016-08-01,AGT4XPUDRYTU2LLWOOU2J2OJSCIA,B. Pearce,5.0,Pass the butter! Love this popcorn!,"  Tiny popcorn kernels but love love love how tender this popcorn is while still being crisp. The hulls are so much better than the larger type of popcorn. I used to go through and pick out the popcorn and pick off the hulls before I would eat it because I hated getting those hulls stuck in my teeth, but don't have to do that with this popcorn. I did have a lot of unpopped kernels though, but that might be my fault. I tend to turn off the heat so I don't risk burning the popcorn and this does seem to take a little more heat to start popping and with all the kernels in a 1/2 cup, that's a lot of kernels to pop. Still, I would rather have unpopped kernels than burned popcorn so for me, I'll err on the underpopped. If you're a popcorn fanatic like I am, you'll love this! Pass the butter!",0

If I had to put a number on it, I'd say there are about 50% less hulls than regular popcorn. Enough that some hulls still got caught in my teeth. Secondly, when they pop, they make little gnarly puffs of popcorn. I suppose this is why they are called ""Baby"". These things are quite small when popped and I like nice big fluffy popcorn. I've got 6 lbs of it so I suppose I'll eat it but I won't enjoy it much.",0

B00VJMJZ1I,2016-09-26,AFEYXXTLUBRDEMBISCW4YD2NRNYQ,Cagayan,5.0,Great Tasting Tender Popcorn,"  This is awesome popcorn. Its very small when popped and very tender. Previously I had tried the ""Crimson Jewell Premium Popcorn - Net Wt. 28.35 oz"" - it is also very good but nearly twice as expensive per oz as this Amish Baby White (6 Pounds).    For popping, I use one of the Silicone Microwave Popcorn Poppers I purchased at Amazon - with great results. My recipe: 1/3 Cup of the Baby White ""Hulless"", 1 TBSP of virgin coconut oil, 1/4 tsp of popcorn salt. This is the right amount to fill the popper. I will set my microwave for 3 minutes and listen intently for the popping to nearly stop and also smell intently for any hint of burning. Note: I will also place the popper off center slightly on the microwave turntable to help prevent the popcorn from burning as it rotates in the microwave. Less (or no) oil can be used as desired. I like the taste of coconut oil and it helps the salt stick to the popcorn - at least that is my theory.",0

It was sent in a padded envelope that was a bit damaged so popcorn bag was ripped and it spilled when I opened envelope. That aside, popcorn was very tender and tasty, no complaint there.

The mil thickness of the plastic just isn't strong enough to hold six pounds of kernels (the size I ordered). Because very little had leaked out and because I'd selected Prime shipping, I wasn't overly concerned with the kernels having gotten stale with air exposure, so I let it pass.    Waited a couple weeks until I was in a popcorn mood and poured out my first batch worth. Right on top was a nice rock mixed in the kernels. Because of the kernels smaller size and the color of the rock being similar, I almost didn't notice it and had I not noticed, it would likely have done more damage than regular popcorn kernels, which is how I got here.    Having never heard of hulless popcorn, I was excited because I have lots of problems getting popcorn hulls wedged into the gums of my wisdom teeth. As the product says, going in, I knew: ""Not technically without hulls, our ""hulless"" variety has a smaller kernel that generally has a more tender hull. When it pops, the hull breaks into smaller pieces and does not get noticed by getting into your teeth."" Well, after popping the first batch and eating it, I still had kernels in my gums and teeth. So if you're like me and hoping that last part was true, it's not. At least I found it not be to.    The corn did pop up well, and it is a smaller kernel so the pops are smaller. Tasted fine, but given the broken bag, the rock I almost didn't find and the need to sift the rest of the bag, and the hulls still posing a problem, I can't recommend this product.",0

PILCHER,2.0,"For the amount of hull, the lack of taste and the cost, try something else.","  I purchased this popcorn specifically for my mother, she loves popcorn but can't eat it because of the hull. She couldn't even finish the small bowl I gave to her to try, she had to pick out and floss what was stuck in her teeth, for her it was uncomfortable. I know there is always some hull, but the way it is advertised, the hull should be almost un-noticeable. I suppose the smallness of the popcorn increased noticing hull and it seemed to me quite a bit, even when I used my Whirley Pop Popcorn Popper, which some customers found improves the popcorn.  As for the number of as they call ""Old Maids"" (unpopped kernel), it seemed high to me. The taste of the White Baby lacked in comparison to Orville Redenbacher and even Jiffy Pop.  The cost was much too high for the product, in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend the Baby White Amish, especially to someone who is looking to get the hull-less because of teeth and gum issues.",0

I've used an electric hot air popcorn machine,with a line indicating the load limit.After the first load, so much popped popcorn spilled out,I was able to refill the large round container being used.Now I only fill the hot air popcorn machine to 1/4"" below the fill line, which easily fills up my large round container to the top,.The bonus is the much better flavor with a very small amount of unpopped kernels.I use a stainless steel sprayer on my finished popcorn. The very best quality and flavor comes from Costco avocado oil in a 33.8 oz. glass bottle. After using several different types of popcorn salt,I chose Dr. Barbara Hendel's Himalayan Crystal Salt.This salt is very fine,without any artificial colors or flavors added.At first, I was using way too much,because this salt has a much stronger,saltier flavor than regular,ordinary table salt or sea salt,(which is unsuitable for popcorn because the salt crystals are huge in comparison) so I had to restrict the 11 hole top of my small dispenser down to 4, to suit my taste.The stainless steel sprayer,available from Amazon, shoots a very thin oil stream.

I’ve made popcorn three times & love the flavor. The trick is not to use a tight lid, (I know the video showing instructions on how to make the popcorn says to use a tight lid). If you keep the smoke and steam trapped, you get stale tasting popcorn!! I use 1 tablespoon butter ghee and 1 coconut oil on high heat, throw in 3 kernels & when they’re popped I take them out and throw in 1/2 cup popcorn (this makes a huge bowl). I put a lid on but keep lifting the edge to let smoke out. I lower the heat, and popcorn is done in just a few minutes. Add a bit of salt & whatever seasonings u like. I like with Parmesan cheese. I don’t add extra butter since the ghee is enough flavoring for me. I would buy this again.",0

The kernels are tiny but very flavorful, and after tasting this popcorn we had a hard time getting the rest of the household to finish off the larger-kernel popcorn we had on hand. We will only be ordering hull-less from now on, both microwave and loose corn for the popper.    We will be ordering Amish Country specifically, too. The price proved to be competitive with other brands of hull-less that we tried, and the flavor is decidedly better.",0
B0140NBD9Y,2017-12-20,AH5JRPT676KL4JBQZEIEOXAWV74A,StarChaser Tyger,5.0,Almost actually hullless,"  Pretty good popcorn, not a huge butter flavor, and needs salt, but definitely worth buying.    It's not possible to have totally hull-less popcorn, since the shell is what makes it pop, The water inside the seed boils, melting the starch, until the outer coating can't take the pressure anymore and ruptures. The molten starch expands, but the quick release of pressure 'freezes' it and it congeals into the fluffy white popcorn stuff. If you stick normal corn in the microwave, you get hot corn, because it can't build up pressure.    The individual poofs are smaller than one is used to, so its less popped popcorn by volume, a given bowl will look less full, but its denser than standard popcorn, a little chewier. And honestly very close to no shells. Normal popcorn, I spend an hour or so digging shrapnel out of my gums, but this has had at most one or two small bits. Will definitely buy it again, although probably the unflavored and melt the butter and salt myself.    Don't use the popcorn button. Set it for five minutes, and stand there until the noise stops. It takes about two minutes for my microwave and the batch of popcorn I got, but as an agricultural product, your mileage will vary. Don't expect the popcorn button to do anything well, it's a best guess. You should be able to entertain yourself sufficiently to survive two minutes.",0

I eat a gluten free diet so always looking for a sweet wheat free treat. This popcorn is a perfect blend of sweet and salty. It is better tasting then anything I have found at my local grocer. The popcorn is lighter and fluffier then most and is not overly buttery. If you love kettle corn, give this a try it's worth the extra money.",0

I bought this when my 10 year old son got his spacer put in as a prelude to braces. It's an arduous journey, this path to straighter teeth, but butter popcorn makes it easier. Pops easily and good butter flavor. Will definitely buy again!",0

I HATE HATE HATE most microwave popcorns as they have far too many hulls - they get stuck in your teeth and take up most of the popcorn. But this, WOW! It pops up in the same amount of time as most regular microwave bags but comes out much smaller. But the flavor . . . and the low amount of hulls . . .perfect! There is not an overwhelming amount of ""flavoring"" so you can still doctor it up with the stuff you like. HIGHLY recommend!",0

B0140NBD9Y,2015-12-28,AGRN5PV7DDFYEO7FY75KOS5BAABA,Luv2Sing,5.0,Am sold on this!,"  I read some of the reviews where the kernels either didn't pop or were burned, but you have to figure out where your microwave cooks the bag the best (they even say that on the bag).    Yes there are hulls, in spite of the name. But they are tiny and soft so it is SO much easier to eat than regular popcorn.",0

When it arrived at my house (after being asked why I paid about $1.80 per bag for popcorn) and I popped the first bag my wife tried it and told me that it was ""the best (expletive) popcorn ever"" I agreed.

She ordered some for my husband and me last year and a few more times since. She just passed away suddenly and so I am ordering it myself now. It sort of has a sentimental value to me now. I like that there are almost no hulls. The kernels are very small, but not an issue because they are so tasty. I will be ordering more and recommend it to anyone who loves popcorn but not the hulls.",0

It's hard to figure out the ""popping time"" for this microwave popcorn. It either comes out under-popped or burnt... not one perfectly popped bag! The kernels are really small, and I do find that they contain hulls! I bought like 4 boxes of this, and unfortunately am stuck with them. On the plus side, they have a great butter flavor to them. To each is own - I don't like it. I'll stick with my Orville Redenbacher or Act II microwave popcorn.",0

We live only an hour away from Shipshewana, IN, and usually buy in bulk when we are there. But, it can be hard to find the time to get there when we start to run out.

Had to use 3 bags to get 1 decent bowl of popcorn. Additional time only burned the popped kernels. The terrible thing is that I purchased THREE boxes (30 bags) and I cannot return it!

It burned up in my microwave in less than 2 minutes and hardly anything had popped before it turned into a black mess. I ended up throwing the remaining 9 bags away. Not sure I will ever get the burnt smell out of my house. I hope that if you try this, you will have a better outcome than I did.",0

The popcorn pops up smaller than normal popcorn. I was disappointed in the butter flavor. It did not taste very buttery at all. I had to add extra butter or seasonings to get a better taste. I usually pop this corn and another brand and mix the two together to achieve a better tasting popcorn.,0

One issue was the cooking time, it’s a bit of a learning curve. We put in the microwave on the “popcorn” setting but it only popped about half the bag. The next bag we tried quickly restarting the “popcorn” cooking setting after the first setting stopped and did the typical count for 2 seconds between pops until we didn’t hear anymore pops for the count of 2 seconds then removed the bag... Umm, results: Popcorn burned bad, not a good idea. So basically the cooking works best on the “popcorn” microwave sensing setting but, most bags are only about half popped or a tad more. Taste and texture is yummy 😋 and good👍🏽 but didn’t seem to get a full bag so that factored in with price wasn’t very cost effective for us.  **Update: We keep cooking it for bout 15 seconds after the popcorn sensing setting stops and that seems to do the trick... all but a few kernels popped. We since came to really love the taste and tiny feel of this Amish Country popcorn and will continue to purchase it.👍🏽😉",0

I thought I looked carefully enough, but this too contains sucralose. I cannot have sucralose, so I personally cannot even test the flavor of this popcorn. But yeah, the ingrediants also include artificial butter flavor so all natural is an extremely false claim. Extremely disappointed by the false claims and lack of label information. I will give my purchase to a friend amd maybe they can enjoy it.",0

B003ZJJ4K0,2016-05-10,AHY6BLJEPMVDSFDHDJNTXRNY37GA,Madeline R.,4.0,Earthy but excellent!,"  I decided to try this brand as the company in NM I used to get my various popcorns from has woeful customer service. Amish Country turns out to be a good source for purple popcorn. It's pretty, and pops up nicely into medium size white puffs in my Whirley Popper. (I use just a touch of avocado oil and finish with some sea salt and green chile powder.) My only issue is that occasional kernels taste like dirt - ok, earth. It's not a terribly bad thing if I think of what terroir is to wine, but still, it's kind of a musty flavor that makes me wonder how Amish Country stores its corn. I do plan to order this again though, and in our house six pounds do not last long!",1
B003ZJJ4K0,2018-11-18,AGUSVOZ3UXLTKDMOOKOU22J3XGXA,Concerned Consumer,5.0,Additiced and not ashamed.,"  This popcorn changed our lives for the better. We thought that we'd be content eating mediocre popped corn, then we purchased a container of mauve popcorn for like a million dollars from the local boyscouts. It was delicious, but a guy only has so many millions of dollars lying around so I did a search online, probably didn't have to because my phone seems to be listening to every conversation I have lately and ""suggests"" items to purchase that I mention to anyone that I might be talking to. Creepy I know. Anywho, I went ahead and ordered up a bag of these magic kernels and now we're screwed because we have to keep purchasing this product, why you ask, because we are addicted to it. I'm trying to find out if there's a 12 step program to break the habit but I don't mind saying that we are going to enjoy the crap out of it until they come up with a program. I'll be buying some for other folks for Christmas and such because I can't keep a secret to save my life, plus I won't look quite as weird having a severe addiction to this popcorn if'n everybody surrounding me is also addicted. I'll never stop eating this popcorn, don't get me wrong, but I need to slow down a bit just so I can take a breath occasionally. Like I said, we love this popcorn and so will you, make it a part of your life! Did I mention that the price is a great bargain!?! If this review sounds disjointed it's because I haven't had any popcorn in a few hours....",0

This popcorn has a consistent moisture content and tastes great to me. The pop-percentage is sometimes a little lacking, but the taste is most important to me. If you are like me and do traditional cast-iron popping, beware that this will scorch quickly compared to ""Orville R"" type popcorn (probably due to lower moisture). However, just keep the pan shaking or the kernels tumbling and you wont have a problem. Again, taste is key. Good popcorn.",0

We have tried many colors or flavors and have found that the purple works for us. It pops up great and has a buttery flavor. Tender kernels. We only use canola oil and popcorn salt. Hubby does pop in a whirley pop so that may help increase the flavor. We started buying small packages but now we go for the 6 pound bag. Love this product!,1

Best popcorn ever, gmo free, tons of antioxidants. Cook with some coconut oil and a little bit of olive oil to reduce the smoke point and you've got a healthy snack. I use a little himilayan pink salt but the purple popcorn needs less seasoning that most as it has a nice flavor all on its own. 3 stars instead of five because they didn't offer to replace my order",0

I normally use olive oil to pop it in, melted butter and salt once popped, and its perfect every time. It can stand up to a variety of different flavorings. I really cannot say enough good things about this product. Found my ""holy grail"" popcorn, and will NEVER go back to microwaved.",0

With store bought yellow corn, there would be 2 Tbsp would remain unpopped.    My only concern about the popcorn is the packaging - just a plastic bag with a twist tie, no seals of any kind.

B003W0JWCC,2016-01-22,AEDTTBVSDVOTA4PCWLJV2H7VIOTQ,Otto Pilot,4.0,Flavored Salt,"  This stuff surprised me a little, as I normally don't go for things like this. It is a nice departure from adding real butter; maybe makes it a tiny bit healthier. It is a very fine grain, so it is easier to get it to stay on the popped kernels. I have found that the best method for this is to have the shaker ready, and when you pull the lid off, get the shaker going while the popped kernels still have some moisture on them. I think it tastes better than plain salted so long as you don't get carried away, and it is easy to do because the shaker holes allow for a large flow, which is my only criticism.",1

I usually add a spritz of oil to the pope corn before I sprinkle it on and it adheres well to the popped corn unlike some popcorn flavorings that sink immediately to the bottom of the bowl. The taste is yummy and reminiscent of popcorn at the circus and zoos as well as the ballpark; not a new fangled flavor if that is what you are looking for, but a more traditional flavor, definitely salty and slightly zesty, but not cheesy. You don't need a lot on each batch (too much and it is too salty) and this bottle is lasting for a while.",1

No luck. Had waste at bottom of bowl.

B003W0JWCC,2017-02-01,AFT5UTLSJ537Z5OXCCQIF55RGLAA,Tyler Hoff,5.0,More please,  My wife and I love popcorn as a night snack. I used to always buy the movie theater butter microwave bags but my wife got me hooked on the simply salted kind and now the butter ones taste greasy.  Well I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my wife and I'm so glad I did. We will airpop popcorn and use this and it taste exactly like movie theater and ball park popcorn. I wish it had a lid that closed or something since once you peel the sticker on the top it's forever open. Used on about 50 bowls of popcorn and about 1/4 gone. I'd say a bottle should last 8-12 months.,1
B003W0JWCC,2015-09-13,AHTTKNMFNDXLP63V7BCG3HSR6YPQ,Christopher Holland,3.0,Not so great for air-popped popcorn.,"  It's unclear to me that this is ""better than plain salt,"" at least for my purposes -- I air-pop my popcorn so I add butter and salt after the popping process. Because air-popped popcorn is so dry salt in general doesn't stick to it well. Like regular fine popcorn salt, most of this flavored salt ends up at the bottom of the popcorn bowl. If you have to add butter (or hot sauce! yum) to the popcorn anyway, what good is ""buttery tasting"" popcorn salt?    I imagine this is great if, as in movie theaters, one were to pop the popcorn in oil and this salt from the start, but for air-popped, you can probably skip it and go straight for regular old popcorn salt.    This stuff tastes OK but it's pricey and the salt overwhelms any flavor it might actually be bringing to the party.",1

Very disappointed as we had received these varieties last year in a multi-variety pack along with the stove top popper and they were great, cooked up light and fluffy. These kernels must be old as they had lots of widows in the bunch as well as hulls and various unidentified nasty stuff (even the so called hull-less) and it even burned in the bottom of the popper. Not even store brand corn did that. Save your money and buy grocery store kernels or the stuff from The Boys Scouts.",1

I always make Cinnamon Popcorn and Caramel Popcorn. I thought why not step it up this year and use some virtually hulless popcorn? Well, I am totally disappointed in this product. I followed directions on the pack of popcorn---it took forever to start popping....and it seemed the corn was ""burning"" prior to begin popping. I used a medium heat per package directions.

The kernels only half pop so part of it is soft and part is hard which makes it unpleasant to eat. I had to waterpick forever to get them out of my teeth.

I'm a bigger fan of the the medium hull-less because it pops nicely and doesn't have many hulls, but it's not really completely without hulls. And the large caramel type is definitely not that great.

B00GP0EZ14,2016-01-13,AEDTTBVSDVOTA4PCWLJV2H7VIOTQ,Otto Pilot,4.0,Mixed Varieties Of Popcorn,"  The key here is knowing what you are getting; this is a type of ""baby"" popcorn which does not expand like the big yellow kernels that you find at the movies. It is closer to the standard white variety, but maybe slightly smaller, although not really the most tiny you can get. It is more of a preference thing than anything else; the big yellow varieties tend to fluff up more but leave behind larger and more complete hull pieces, while varieties like this tend to produce smaller kernels but less of the hulls. I believe there is a slight difference in the taste also, but that is subjective. The only real rule to remember when popping most of these types of varieties is to cook in small batches; maybe that is why so many people prefer the larger, yellow varieties. If you dump a bunch of this in your machine the way you do with the larger kernels, it will most likely burn before most of it is popped.    The colors? Well I can't tell the difference after it is popped, but maybe someone else can. The bags we received popped well, and it tastes fine, but no better than others I have found locally. As far as freshness goes, I don't believe any of it is right from the field; I don't think it would even pop that way. So the question is whether or not it is worth it, and I believe this makes a good gift for the right person when combined with some flavorings and special salt.",0

Once the 2 kernels both popped, I dropped in 1/3 cup of the Rainbow Unique Blend corn, added a bit of kosher salt, covered the pot, and just shook it back and forth over the (gas of course) stove top. I didn't time it, just listened until the the rapid popping slowed, turned off the heat, uncovered, and poured into a waiting bowl which was too small as I think all but one kernel popped.

The blue corn is too little to pop in it because most of it pops right out of the popper without getting to pop, so it's wasted. Only the yellow corn is heavy enough to stay in the popper until popped.... So I recommend using a regular pan to pop the blue and mixed varieties, the old-fasioned way. Disappointing to me though.",0

If you do a little research you will find out all of the magical ingredients that allow you to make movie theatre style popcorn at home and it is EXTREMELY easy to make.

This just arrived and I immediately popped up a six quart kettle using coconut oil and garlic salt for seasoning. It is very flavorful and tender. I have been buying equal amounts of white and yellow popcorn at the stores and mixing them equally in my storage container. I like aspects of both white and yellow popcorn, but found that I never liked it when I popped only one type at a time. This bag of the Rainbow popcorn has those same features by blending several different popcorn types together so there are slightly different kernel sizes and textures together in the same batch. I know that I will now be saving time at grocery stores and ordering all my popcorn from Amish Country via Amazon.",0

Ignore the haters!,"  After reading the reviews, including the bad ones, I was determined to review as soon as it arrived so I made myself some right away. First the colors of the kernels were beautiful. There was some corn meal floating around the bag but otherwise it was very clean and pretty. I have a single serving air popper. I noticed immediately that the kernels were not flying around as the other organic/nongmo brands I used, signifying a firm, dense kernel. It took a tad bit longer before it began popping, makes sense for dense kernels. When they began popping it was like a show! Huge, gigantic popcorn with varied colors! Amazing! Almost all of it popped too, very little unpopped/half popped. The taste was unreal, so good. I only added a bit of salt as I prefer non greasy popcorn. Some of it was a bit more crunchy than others but, hey, we want nongmo because it’s natural and that means variety. Most of it was yummy crunchy. I know that the Amish work is quality and I was determined to review accordingly and I am not disappointed. I will be buying exclusively from them from now on. There is no better.

Yes, the popped corn is small..so what???? There are also some unpopped kernels. But there are those in the store brands too.

Believe the reviews you read! Same day I received the popcorn I made a batch and it has the distinct flavor of mold. YUCK! That's right you can taste it after it's popped and it's disgusting. I can't see mold on the kernels but the taste is god awful. I will never order popcorn from here again. I would give it negative stars if I could.

The colors do show on the inside of the popped popcorn, making the batch appear to be burnt, but it's not. We use a Whirly Pop to pop ours and there are hardly any kernels un-popped. It's hard to believe, but there is a slight distinct flavor between the colors. We first bought a sampler pack and tried each one to see which we like best, we like them all!

B00017LEZC,2018-03-12,AEQLYKSFVXT6BU7H7JFUCZUJ2L5A,Wontae,1.0,Small popcorn and difficult to pop,"  I’m no popcorn connoisseur but I have a couple problems with this popcorn. Firstly, the popcorn that is popped is way too small. I feel like I’m eating bits of fragmented popcorn instead of nice big fluffy popcorn. Secondly, the varying sizes of the kernels makes it difficult to actually pop the corn. I make my popcorn on the stove via a pot so the differing popping times leaves a lot of unpopped kernels.    As far as taste goes, I don’t get the ‘nutty’ flavor that people are referring to. Maybe I’m a simpleton but the Target pop corn kernels are -0x better in my humble opinion.",0

I have no issue with taste, texture or size of the kernel.  We cook this over the stove top. It takes way longer to pop because a lot of the kernels are duds, which means you kinda get a burnt flavor if you go longer to get them to pop. Also, maybe it's just my luck, but I always seem to grab a dud to test if the oil is hot enough for popping, which also makes it super easy to burn the popcorn.  I think the ""hull-less"" claim is a joke. Yes, I'm aware that there's always going to be a hull, but these are supposed to be softer. This product tears my mouth up worse than jolly-time. I have shells stuck all up in my mouth, it's like popcorn shrapnel.  I'm really disappointed with this product and I'm eating it as fast as I can so I can get some cheap stuff.

It arrived with its Beta Carotene enhanced color - OK, I'm all about carrots, but then I read the rest of the ingredients, ""partially hydrogenated canola oil."" I don't need anything hydrogenated, partially, or otherwise, on my popcorn. If that's what I want, I'll walk down to the Valley Theater and buy a bucket.    At least Chefs.com found irony in it as well and quickly gave me a refund over the phone for the amount I paid.",1

The flavor is great, and I love that you can crunch the few half-popped kernels.    Heads up if you have an air popper - the first time I tried this kind, I lost at least half the kernels as they flew out unpopped due to the size and weight. The tip I found somewhere else was to tip your air-popper back a little bit until the popcorn is hot enough that it starts popping and then set it down. This saves a ton of kernels.

My half of what was popped contained about 30 hulls: not unpopped kernels, although there were a few of those also, both whole bits that can't be chewed and the cup-shaped empties that don't digest.

B00M9NO8PO,2017-11-09,AEN35X74JZP6NICTMW2DEIK5QJVA,Liis,5.0,Atypical yumminess,"  Great tasting non gmo. Not your typical corn in more than one way.    It's sweet and flavorful. (Unlike yellow baby corn which is usually regular corn rejects that are not big enough kernels to be regular popcorn and really has not much of a taste besides the popcorn smell. Even tiny but mighty heirloom popcorn brand has really no flavor and it's 30 more calories.)    The hullessness of this midnight corn is flawless is does not get stuck in your teeth like regular popcorn.    It air pops well in a chute air popper with a few tricks (see pics): lid under the chute side until the kernels pop up then it's removed (or u can just tilt it back with your hand) and a stainless steel half cup measuring cup to keep the kernels in until they start to pop then it's also removed. Other reviwers have mentioned it air pops in a bowl air popper with no tricks mentioned.    There r a few non popped kernels but not any more than usually.    This is my go to popcorn I just add Celtic sea salt.    It's true the popcorn is four eighty nine without shipping on the manufactures site so the extra fee here is shipping added in.    And finally the packaging is atypical; it comes in a plastic bag with just a twist tie. Mostly food items are sealed in one way or another nowadays with the minumum of tape around the bag. But there are exceptions when you buy items in a store, roadside stand, cider mill, etc. : fresh fruit and veggies are not sealed either are dry bulk items. So packaging maybe usually after all.",0

Having been unable to eat popcorn for more than 10 years, I was excited to find this product. I popped my first batch last night and was relatively disappointed in the amount of husks I found on the popped corn after popping. I had researched very closely many types of ""hull less"" popcorn, realizing that no popcorn is truly hull less. However, there were far more than I expected. The taste was delicious even though I went overboard on the butter and salt this time around. I'll chalk this up to lack of popping experience since I'm out of practice and will continue to perfect my skills hoping that better popping will result in fewer hulls. Only a few kernels were left unpopped and that was great!    UPDATE: After several attempts at popping this ""new to me"" popcorn - it's all I eat now. I guess there was a little bit of a learning curve to pop these small kernels and now I have it mastered. We bought a Hamilton Beach popcorn popper with the plastic dome lid and the little metal wand that spins in the bottom ""heating"" portion. I add the popcorn oil and let it get good and hot, pour in the popcorn and quickly put the bowl on top. The popcorn pops almost immediately. As soon as it almost stops popping, I invert the popper, add some butter and salt and we are good to go! I've repeatedly bought this popcorn and have never had any issues (and I've eaten bowl after bowl....).",1

My husband and I are popcorn connoisseurs of a sort, and this Amish Country Lady Fingers is the best we've found after more than a decade of trying different brands and types. The popped kernels are very small and also hulless, which makes it the most digestible popcorn I've found to date (comparatively--mind you, it is still popcorn so you still have to be careful). The taste is perfect and every kernel pops every time. Six pounds doesn't last long in our house.",0

Amazon prime was kind enough to refund my money. I've been a regular popcorner for years, but recently found I have a serious GI issue and it was suggested I try the ""hulless"" variety. Perhaps another product will work better for me, at least in terms of popping it. Of note, the seller does state that one can use a hot air popper with their product.

Those that complain about it being tough are probably following the directions WVF gives, IE heat the oil with 2-3 kernels, wait for them to pop then add the full amount, this IME yields tough kernels and more partial popped ones. I use a great Northern stovetop stainless steel stir popper, I preheat the burner, but add the kernels, Flavacol, and coconut oil to a cold pot and get amazing results every time, light and crispy, full of flavor with a hint of sweetness, no need to add anything after the fact, just pour into bowls and devour. Slow even heating of the kernels yields light and fluffy corn, already hot oil pops a little faster but its always noticeably tougher.",1

I mean it tastes ok, but this stuff is so small I've resorted eating it witha spoon like cereal. The popped kernels are about the size of Cap'n Crunch. Oh and as far as the hulless claim...yeah right. This stuff has more hulls than average popcorn. But now I've got close to six pounds of it to get used to the stuff. Maybe I'll give it to someone and see if they like it.",0

I did pop some the old fashioned way in a pan on the stove. It worked pretty good, but the popcorn still had hulls, and wasn't very tender. Sad I bought so much. Wouldn't buy this type again.",0

We got this for my mother-in-law at her request and kept a little for ourselves to try. Unfortunately we put it in the same container as our other popping corn.  Here's why I say unfortunately.:  The kernels are very, very small.  They have a high husk to popped corn ratio and so that's mostly what you end up tasting and crunching on when you eat it.  I'm kind of sensitive to texture, so it may bother me more than others.  I pop my pop corn in a pot with hot coconut oil (no flavor) and then sprinkle with sea salt. Very yummy...usually, but not with this stuff.",1

If the only popcorn you've experienced is the *Popular-Brandname-Popcorn* stuff from the store, you're in for the biggest treat.    First of all, this is ""hulless"" or ""very light hulls"" which means that all the popcorn shells that normally get stuck in your teeth / all over your gums / everywhere NO LONGER DO!! The kernels are so light that instead of always getting the hulls stuck in your teeth like popular namebrand popcorn, they very rarely get stuck in your teeth. This alone makes this popcorn hands down the best thing ever.. but wait there's more!    Secondly, this popcorn lasts a VERY long time. The kernels are very small but pop nice and fluffy. The bag will last you a very long time and you won't need to use that much with each popping. I use a WhirleyPop to pop the popcorn (which I also highly recommend) and all I have to do is lightly coat a single layer of popcorn on the bottom and I pop up a full WhirleyPop of popcorn.    Thirdly, the popcorn is delicious. Can't stop eating it. In fact I'm going to pop myself some right now.",1

I was excited to see a hull-less kernel. Here's what I found: For the kernels that pop completely there is no hull. For those that don't they're still eatable and don't choke you, if you have healthy teeth. The kernel are really, really small and remain small when popped. You need to pop 3-4 handfuls to equal a bag of microwavable popcorn. Other than that I love the Lady Finger and it's a small price to pay for choke-less popcorn.",0
B00M9NG2J4,2013-01-12,AGGQ3HYL42R2FLYLV7O5OMFY6NAA,Duchino,5.0,Great Popcorn - very small kernels,"  I eat a lot of popcorn from my old Salton Hot-Air popper; and this is by far my favorite popcorn to use. ""Hull-less"" is not important to me; but the flavor is great and the popped kernels are very small so are more dense in the bowl.    I have three observations from my hot-air popping experience (6 pounds so far):  A) there is more chaff that blows onto the kitchen counter (I guess the commercial brands all blow-clean their popcorn?). It is like a little lint. I will try to shake it off in the future  B) I think it takes a bit longer to pop than major brands. Usually there is one big wave of popped product, then a delay of perhaps 30 to 45 seconds; then the remainder all pops. There are somewhat more unpopped kernels than with the major brands  C) Once in a great while in my hot air popper, the kernels get jammed in a mass and stop circulating in the blowing hot air. You need to just shake them loose or touch them with a plastic utensil and they go back on their way.    I am just noting these experiences for your guidance - nothing detracts from the fact that this is the best choice out there.    P.S. I just add salt to the hot air popcorn. To make it taste better, I mix in some packaged popcorn like Herr's, and the result has fewer calories and oil but tastes great.",1

I do have a strange like/dislike relationship with this popcorn. My first impression was ""OMG, it's popping all over my kitchen"". My second impression was, ""Look how cute it is"", followed by ""this tastes REALLY good"". And finally, ""I need a spoon to eat this stuff"".    Love:  1. It truly is a very ""clean"" popcorn. The lack of hulls makes it 100% worthwhile  2. Taste: It's delicious.    Not so much love:  1. I suppose because the small seeds are so light, it is truly (as one review said) a volcanic erruption. I had to hold a towel over the opening to my air popper to assure the seeds stayed inside and didn't fly all over the kitchen. If you want to entertain small children, pets or even yourself, put in the recommended 1/2 cup and stand back and watch the show. You can totally get around this by adding a generous 3/4 cups of seeds instead of the ""do not exceed"" 1/2 cup. It has caused no problems with our popper.  2. Because the kernels are so small it's easy to drop them before you get them to your mouth. This doesn't bother me that much, but it was a deal breaker for my mother when she came for a visit.    Overall, I would definitely recommend this popcorn for it's taste. My 5-year old loves the small size so I'll break out my spoon and deal with the tiny kernels.",1

The first time I tried to make the popcorn in my hot-air popper, approximately 60% of the kernels blew out of the chamber un-popped into the bowl. The kernels are just TOO SMALL for it to pop correctly in the machine that I have been using for years. Personally, I have never seen kernels that small. I made a hasty decision because Amazon was temporarily out of my usual purchase (Great Northern 12.5# bag)  Most of the reviews mention that ""Ladyfinger"" will not work well in hot air or oil based poppers, right off the bat. I mean: ""what could go wrong with a bag of popcorn?"" Plenty, it seems. Will throw the rest of the corn out.",0

We have two kids in braces so thought this might be good popcorn for them. Taste is very good, but we've popped 6-7 batches in an air popper and there are way too many unpopped kernels and too many partially popped kernels that you have to chew very carefully so you don't bite down on them. Our cheap brand popped as well or better for a lot less money! Maybe we got a bad bag or need to cook it in oil on the stove to see if that helps. Too expensive to have to be this careful so won't buy it again.",1

I've tried all kinds of other varieties of popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms and this specific one is my favorite by far. The hulls are so small and delicate they don't get stuck in your teeth! The popcorn is also extremely flavorful. It is much more tasty then any of the popcorn I've ever bought at the grocery store. It is so delicate and delicious that you can actually eat the occasional ""old maid"" kernels that didn't pop without chipping teeth. It doesn't gain volume quite as dramatically as other varieties of popcorn, but it is more filling as a result. I like to pop it on the stove with some olive oil and then top it with half olive oil and half butter to further enhance the flavor. It is my favorite snack. Once you go with the ladyfinger popcorn, you'll never go back.",1

B00M9NG2J4,2018-10-03,AHILMP36BJ53DK7LVTFTU2YWW4EQ,"Living Beyond Life, LLC",4.0,Pros and Cons,"  Large bag of tiny kernel popcorn.    Pros: Doesn't get stuck in hot air popper (happens with larger kernels when over loaded)  Almost all of it pops, and the ones that don't are crunchy and delicious (half-popped)  Hulls aren't as large or bothersome (there are less of them)  Price is great for ordering popcorn online    Cons:  Wasn't looking when I ate it and definitely tasted mold two times so far (could have been in the kernal? I am less than 25% of the way through the bag). It was very unpleasant and lingered on my palate. Not sure if anything can be done about this. It is pretty gross, but I will keep making it and eating it because of the large quantity to gross piece ratio.",0

I have been making kettle corn using a Whirley Pop and after testing tons of batches with cheap generic popcorn to get the right balance, I was ready to use something a little special. The kernels do not pop and when I dump the popcorn out, there are tons of unpopped kernels on the bottom of the pan glued to the kettle ingredients. I tried various alterations, used a ton of expensive coconut oil, and now I do not have the product I promised to bring this evening. This was such a disappointment and now I have 10 pounds of a product I can't use.",0

B00INM1OQ6,2016-03-01,AH7JTN35W3RUNFPYHSWFOY42DO5A,Amazon Customer,2.0,Unacceptable mold ruined an otherwise great product,"  I really wanted to give this a great review, because the popcorn is really good and it's fun to try the different varieties. However, we have tried 3 of the 7 bags and found moldy kernels in each bag. It's impossible to find mold on the un-popped kernels, but once popped, every three or four bites greets you with a disgusting, lasting, strong flavor of mold. With no dates on any of the bags, I can't tell if this product is unacceptably old or if it was stored in improper facilities.    To be sure, I've popped this popcorn with canola, olive, and coconut oil, all fresh, on different occasions to make sure the oil wasn't the problem. I've also omitted toppings, and sure enough the plain popcorn popped with fresh oil has the mold flavor.    Thus, I've contacted Amazon about a return or refund, not knowing which would be best since it's an opened food product. I don't see a point in even trying the other bags. I will probably try this again, as the non-moldy popcorn was great, but I will order direct from Amish Country Popcorn and skip the middle man. I ordered from Grand Lake Country Store and it was fulfilled by Amazon via Amazon Prime.",1

Pops easily--we use a stovetop popper with coconut oil--tiny amount of seeds remain un-popped which is a definite plus but the best part is how great this corn tastes great--YUMMY! Just yesterday we had the ""mushroom"" variety which pops into these large lightly yellow colored kernels that are slightly chewy but still crisp. We also popped up some of the Red-Few hulls- variety which pops into medium sized white kernels that are light and crispy. A person really can't go wrong with this variety pack as the Rainbow has been fun-since there are yellow and white kernels with many textures, the Blue and Purple varieties are just plain tasty, not to mention fun due to the bright colors decorating the kernels. The most difficult part will be choosing a favorite!!",1

And let me tell you...this variety pack is absolutely amazing. Firstly, you get a ton of popcorn. The different varieties are awesome. You can really tell a difference between the different types, and it's fun for my fiancé and me to try them out! For those complaining about unpopped kernels, that is what you get with gourmet popcorn. I'll save the old maids and try to pop them again the next time. The ones that stay unpopped don't bother me because the value that you still get is totally worth it. I've bought this variety pack twice and I'm going to purchase it a third time right after leaving this review. Thank you Amish Country for such wonderful popcorn!",1

A great trick I use to manage my weight is to eat a nice bowl of dry popcorn at night popped in a microwave popcorn popper, and this is my favorite one! The kernels pop up nice and big and fluffy. The flavor is nice and pure. As has been noted, there are occasionally some hulls that float around, but to me, it's totally worth it and they crunch up in my mouth just fine.    Just for fun, one night, I popped a smaller batch of this stuff, and a small batch of store bought name brand popcorn. The difference was obvious from the start, but I then crushed a few pieces of each (because the size is a dead giveaway), and tried pieces randomly. The taste wasn't even close, this stuff was FAR better and easy to pick out.",0
B003ZJKG1G,2017-12-09,AHJPCMQ3PGH2RFR7DCWF32TLVTVA,Michael Breuker,3.0,"Nice flavor, but not large as advertised","  I was looking for extra large popcorn so that we could make an edible Christmas Tree garland. I know that popcorn used for caramel corn and kettle corn would be about right. These kernels popped fluffy and have a nice flavor, but about 1/4 of the kernels didn’t pop at all.    The biggest disappointment, however, is that the kernels were not consistently sized. See the picture I posted for an idea. The kernels range in size from tiny to large, with the bulk of the kernels being on the small side. I had to pop the entire bag in order to pick out enough large kernels to complete the project. Since product advertises these as extra large, you would think that’s what you are getting. It seems whatever sorting method they have for packaging isn’t working.",0

My favorites are the red and blue. For me they are very flavorful and nice delicate texture. I tried the yellow large since i wanted to try a bigger size.  The popped kernels are much larger but a lot chewier. I made both plain and cheese flavored. After adding cheese powder they seem to be even chewier.    I am going back to crimson red.,0
B003ZJKG1G,2018-06-08,AFIKUAGWSTDQ6KC7OOXP5EH6WPHQ,LaTasha,1.0,Disappointed,"  I purchased this product after previously ordering the 2lb bag. Despite reading the reviews I ordered the 6lb bag because my previous purchase was exactly what I asked for. Unfortunately this purchased was the complete opposite. This product is advertised as “mushroom” popcorn; however, only a portion of the kernels are mushroom and the rest are butterfly. I used an air popper and not only was I shocked to see that the kernels were mixed but I was also disappointed that several of the kernels burnt.    I ordered these kernels to complete an order for a graduation party and with dismay I had to inform the customer that she could not receive the product she ordered.",0
B003ZJKG1G,2017-05-10,AGY4H6AWNGSU66KJ5Q2BNFOSSEMQ,Textilall,5.0,Fun,  We usually buy red or blue popcorn because they of their flavor. We decided to try a yellow popcorn for a change and pice the extra large. This corn has popped very well for us. I have notice it works better if I reduce the power of the microwave to 8 or 9 and give it about 30 more seconds vs the smalller colored kernels.  This has a more corn flavor and is very big but with a soft texture. I think it would be great for children because it is easy to chew.,0

I love big kernels of buttery, salty popcorn. Growing up my dad had a preference for tiny white popcorn which I think tends to be more tender but I was always disappointed in the size. Now that I'm making the purchasing decision I go for as big as I can get and yellow. How did I get this far without ever hearing of ""mushroom popcorn""?  I simply use an air popper and wasn't sure how this might turn out based on some reviews here and reading about the best way to pop this type of popcorn. I let my popper warm up for maybe 3-5 minutes before adding the popcorn. Once popped it was definitely mostly mushroom style popcorn, but I did have a small smattering of un-popped kernels on the bottom. I also noticed while eating it that if I ran into a partially popped kernel I had to be very careful. They are very hard and needed to be spit out for fear of breaking a tooth. However, I think these un-popped and partially popped kernels are a result of the air popper. I did a second batch of generic white after this and all of it popped (which is not the norm). I think this was because the entire popper was hot from the first batch. So, I'm satisfied and would both recommend and buy this product again. I know I've bought this brand before in stores but never saw the label, ""mushroom popcorn"", but it was a larger size yellow popcorn that said it was good for caramel corn.  Hmmm, I'm hungry now",0
B00M9NDB1Q,2017-07-06,AEUBDTYEFLXSG2MUCRYLOWY5FLIQ,Donna D.,5.0,Great popcorn!,"  I love this popcorn. I don't know why others are saying that it's soggy, chewy, butterfly, not popping, etc. I use this with a ""Whirlypop"" to make kettle corn. It's awesome. Almost every kernel pops and is delicious. I used to pay $8 for a bag of kettle corn at a fair or farmer's market. Now I make my own with this very popcorn and you can't tell the difference between my homemade and the $8 bag. For those of you looking to duplicate fair kettle corn, invest in a $19.99 Whirlypop at Bed Bath and Beyond (16.99 with online coupon). Use 1/4 cup of your favorite cooking oil, 1/4 cup of this mushroom popcorn, 1/2 tsp of salt and 3-4 Tbsp sugar. It's amazing.",0

It was funny. I purchased a bag of Baby White Amish for my mother, because of her sensitive teeth and gums and difficulty she had with the popcorn hull, I gave her a small bowl she couldn't finish. But when I made kettle corn with the Amish Country Mushroom she tried a little, she loved it, after that when I prepared the kettle corn and it was barely cooled she was right at the table getting herself a bowl to eat and when she finished her bowl she went back for the bag I put the kettle corn in.  I made one batch and I was lucky to get some. With the mushroom popcorn she didn't seem to mind the hull. It seemed to be less than the hull-less popcorn. However, I cooled the kettle corn on a baking sheet and parchment paper. It didn't take long to cool on the baking sheet, the un-popped kernels and hulls were mostly left behind when I scooped the kettle corn into the plastic bag I put the cooled kettle corn in.  There was some unpopped popcorn but not too bad. It was a bit expensive, however I will continue to purchase this.",0

The kernels were dark and small, and really shriveled and dried looking. When we popped them, they tasted hard and stale.    Because of the horrible batch we got from Hoosier Hill Farms, we decided to switch it up and order from Amish Country. SO GLAD WE DID! The popcorn was fantastic and great quality. They actually pop HUGE, the largest mushroom popcorn I've seen. They are so round and pillowy, with a fluffy texture. They are so perfect for seasoning. We make cheddar popcorn and kettle, and these get a really nice and even coating. Really happy with this purchase, and will definitely reorder when we burn through this bag.",0

They are 100% mushroom kernels, just as advertised. They pop big and round, look gorgeous and taste delicious.  Unfortunately, almost half of the kernels didn't pop. The shell is thicker on this kind of kernels, to I know they need a little more oil than the regular ones. I tried with different oil-kernel ratios and it's still the same result. Too much oil, they turn yellow; too little, they burn, but I still can't get half of them to pop.  I bought these as an experiment. They are already almost 4 times the price of the regular kernels, and at a 50% pop ratio, they end up at 8 times the price. It breaks my heart, but I won't buy them again...",0

Fortunately, at least with the batch I got, this is definitely mushroom popcorn. Sure, there is some butterfly, but my estimate is that it's 80% mushroom popcorn, 70% at worst. Of the butterfly, it's like some of those kernals just couldn't quite make it to the ball shape. They tried though.    The popcorn itself is good. And it's big. Much bigger than store bought (e.g. JollyTime White, etc.). It is a bit chewy and definitely has more hulls than typical popcorn, but I'm fine with that. Overall, I love the large size and the texture. It feels like I'm eating something more substantial. It's good with Flavacol (though it takes more than I'm used to for good coverage), and it made really good caramel corn as well.    Finally, it pops fine for me. I use a StirCrazy and pop it following the normal StirCrazy guidelines. Nothing special needed. Sure, some kernals didn't pop, but nothing out of the ordinary.    Final verdict: Thumbs up. I would buy again (and I have -- 6lbs directly from their website).",0

However, this popcorn, while it does have a good popcorn taste, apparently needs a session in a hot oven to crisp it up. When I want a bowl of popcorn, I don't want to take any extra steps just to get what I should get just from popping it. It has a chewy texture that is disappointing. I thought I'd like having my kernels round in shape like this, but I'm finding that I prefer the butterfly corn, probably because there is more surface area to get crunchy. Live and learn . . .",0

It more round and spherical than butterfly popcorn that you buy in the store but the overall volume isn't that much bigger. I was looking for something closer to what we get when we go to the fair or other commercial popped popcorn. All that said, the taste of the popcorn is good and the product was delivered as advertised in other ways. Maybe it has more to do with the popping method than the product?",0

It pops into rounded, chewy kernels that carry the flavor nicely. If you shake it well right after popping then most of the hulls will detach. The hulls are normal for mushroom popcorn. I would not use this popcorn to make regular movie theater-style popcorn. If mushroom popcorn is what you are looking for then you will not be disappointed.",0

Popped on the stove top like OR's, there are unpopped kernals. I will not be buying this again.    UPDATE: it seems I may have been premature in my initial impression.

B00M9NDB1Q,2016-11-18,AFHJXN45MRDDFLVG7KEMEGVPFUVQ,Ben Amos,4.0,Updated review,"  The main reason I purchased this particular popcorn is because it claimed to be mushroom popcorn. Mushroom popcorn pops in balls and is perfect for flavored popcorns like caramel or kettle corn. I was excited to try this popcorn so the moment it was delivered I popped some. It's exactly the same type of popcorn I already had in the pantry.    After doing some research, I learned a lot about this type of popcorn. It's not only the type of popcorn but how you pop it that makes all the difference. I originally gave this popcorn 1 star but I've changed it to 4 after getting the correct popper for this type of corn.    The air-popper and the oil method are not the best way to pop this corn. You need a true popcorn popper. I used my Zippy and it came out beautifully! The kernels popped large and round just as described. The kernels (after cooling off) are crunchy and perfect for caramel and kettle corn. I highly recommend it if you have the correct popper. If you're using an air popper, save the money and stick with a non-GMO white popcorn. You won't be disappointed.",0

I have very few kernels left in the bottom of my bowl. I usually pop 1/2 c of kernels and maybe 10 are left unpopped. The key is to have a really hot oil. I barely open the lid of my pan and throw in my kernels. Swirl it around and they should start popping right quick, if not, your oil wasn't hot enough. I also use a gas range which may also help.

We will stick to another brand that's a little more expensive, but much better quality. Don't waste your money (or good popcorn toppings) on this.",0

I had made the popcorn on the stove and indeed, it didn't have a single ball shaped piece of popcorn in the entire batch. I was extremely disappointed. Since I have a six pound bag I decided I had better eat it anyway, so today I made it in my air popper. What a surprise! I would say 85-90% of the kernels were ball shaped. It tasted better, also. So wanted to post an update and take back everything I said before.",0

I literally refilled a popcorn bag that was purchased from the theater. People loved it so I'm thinking popcorn tins for Christmas. Could be a lot of fun. I just need the recipes.  I did pop the kernels in my Whirley pop with my coconut popping oil with the yellow season salt; hence the color. No butter and the finished product melts in my mouth. This popcorn was popped on Wednesday; photos taken today and taste wonderful.  Tip: let the popped popcorn cool a bit; otherwise it is chewy. If you order fresh popcorn at the movies same tip. I recommend the product; and if skeptical get the 1lb. I got the 2 lb and lasted 3 weeks. . .we love popcorn and very lucky about it. Enjoy,0

B00M9NDB1Q,2018-10-17,AGV6HDSN23JTBN4JWIP4R62AKSFQ,eqvet,2.0,Disappointing pop ratio and texture,"  I was searching for some ""mushroom"" popcorn to make kettle corn when I found this product. Although I noted some mixed reviews on it, I thought I'd give it a try. After trying multiple batches and methods of popping, I have to say that I'm not impressed. My popping methods for this included stove-top, microwave in a microwave popper (Nordic), and microwave in a brown paper bag. I have had good success with all three of these methods in the past with regular ""starburst pop"" popcorn. My first complaint is the ""pop ratio"". In all three methods, there was, in my opinion, an excessive amount of unpopped kernels. Even with the stove-top method (that usually pops probably 95% of the kernels), there were at least 30-40% of the kernels remained unpopped. With the microwave methods, the unpopped kernels were closer to 50%. My second complaint is the texture. The popcorn, to me, was very chewy in nature. Now, I know that mushroom style corn often has more chew to it than the lighter starburst or regular style, but this seemed more than usual.    I will say that, unlike some of the reviews I read, I found that most of the kernels were, indeed, mushroom style popcorn rather than starburst. Unfortunately, that hardly makes up for the poor popping performance and undesirable texture. My search for mushroom popcorn will go on.",0

I prefer Bob's Red Mill popcorn which my wife and I enjoy very much. We also like Orville Redenbacher popcorn. This Amish Country Popcorn Blue pops small with hard hulls. Not a very good combination.

We only use avocado oil to cook it in on the stove and add salt when it is done. No butter or fancy flavors. Sometimes, however, I do pop in leftover bacon grease. It's delicious every which way. It pops up crunchy and never stale or chewy, or at least not the way I make it. I haven't purchased from Amazon, but I buy this at my local farm supply store.",0

The cheese flavors are overly salty compared to Cheddar Cheese Powder by Hoosier Hill Farm, 1 lb. The ""ball park"" salt doesn't stick to the popcorn like regular popcorn salt from the grocery store.    While the sour cream and ranch flavors have those tastes on their own, on popcorn I mostly just tasted salt. They were the ones I really wanted to like so that I could pretend to be eating potato chips.",1
B00VDWVM7Y,2017-03-06,AGMYOG4R6MDU6UPWTYQKEEGRRZFQ,Ark1836,5.0,A great addition to popcorn,"  These are a great addition to popcorn. They make plain popcorn taste better and provide more interest and taste, especially when the popcorn is not soaked in butter. Amish Country makes quality products, and this was not a disappointment. These flavors are easy to use too. You just sprinkle the desired flavor on as soon as the popcorn is finished. Be sure to add it as soon as possible after the popping is done because it sticks better to hot popcorn.",1

You either use the side with the tiny holes and it clogs instantly, or you use the side with the massive singular hole and you get half the container on a small portion of your popcorn.    You can get similar flavorings cheap from a grocery store for much less so that's the reason for the 3/5 stars. The flavorings themselves are great - the containers (or specifically, the lids) are terrible.",1

A great trick I use to manage my weight is to eat a nice bowl of dry popcorn at night popped in a microwave popcorn popper, and this is my favorite one! The kernels pop up nice and big and fluffy. The flavor is nice and pure. As has been noted, there are occasionally some hulls that float around, but to me, it's totally worth it and they crunch up in my mouth just fine.    Just for fun, one night, I popped a smaller batch of this stuff, and a small batch of store bought name brand popcorn. The difference was obvious from the start, but I then crushed a few pieces of each (because the size is a dead giveaway), and tried pieces randomly. The taste wasn't even close, this stuff was FAR better and easy to pick out.",0
B00M9NI7IS,2017-12-09,AHJPCMQ3PGH2RFR7DCWF32TLVTVA,Michael Breuker,3.0,"Nice flavor, but not large as advertised","  I was looking for extra large popcorn so that we could make an edible Christmas Tree garland. I know that popcorn used for caramel corn and kettle corn would be about right. These kernels popped fluffy and have a nice flavor, but about 1/4 of the kernels didn’t pop at all.    The biggest disappointment, however, is that the kernels were not consistently sized. See the picture I posted for an idea. The kernels range in size from tiny to large, with the bulk of the kernels being on the small side. I had to pop the entire bag in order to pick out enough large kernels to complete the project. Since product advertises these as extra large, you would think that’s what you are getting. It seems whatever sorting method they have for packaging isn’t working.",0

After trying a few different types of kernals we're very happy with the extra large popcorn. The regular yellow from Great Northern is very good and the Baby White from Amish is good. But combine all three and you get an excellent balance. The picture speak for themselves showing the obvious size differences (larger to small) between the three types of kernals.,0

My favorites are the red and blue. For me they are very flavorful and nice delicate texture. I tried the yellow large since i wanted to try a bigger size.  The popped kernels are much larger but a lot chewier. I made both plain and cheese flavored. After adding cheese powder they seem to be even chewier.    I am going back to crimson red.,0
B00M9NI7IS,2018-06-08,AFIKUAGWSTDQ6KC7OOXP5EH6WPHQ,LaTasha,1.0,Disappointed,"  I purchased this product after previously ordering the 2lb bag. Despite reading the reviews I ordered the 6lb bag because my previous purchase was exactly what I asked for. Unfortunately this purchased was the complete opposite. This product is advertised as “mushroom” popcorn; however, only a portion of the kernels are mushroom and the rest are butterfly. I used an air popper and not only was I shocked to see that the kernels were mixed but I was also disappointed that several of the kernels burnt.    I ordered these kernels to complete an order for a graduation party and with dismay I had to inform the customer that she could not receive the product she ordered.",0
B00M9NI7IS,2017-05-10,AGY4H6AWNGSU66KJ5Q2BNFOSSEMQ,Textilall,5.0,Fun,  We usually buy red or blue popcorn because they of their flavor. We decided to try a yellow popcorn for a change and pice the extra large. This corn has popped very well for us. I have notice it works better if I reduce the power of the microwave to 8 or 9 and give it about 30 more seconds vs the smalller colored kernels.  This has a more corn flavor and is very big but with a soft texture. I think it would be great for children because it is easy to chew.,0

Out of 3/4 cup, about 1/8 cup remained unpopped (I used the stovetop method with canola oil).

I like to use the mushroom style popcorn for my caramel corn just like what you get from the caramel corn vendors.    If that is what you are looking for, then this is not that type of popcorn.

Now whether it is manufactured in Amish Country or some other religiously affiliated Country it all boils down to being POPCORN SALT.

They will eat the cheap microwave popcorn that is so salty it leaves you feeling parched with a raw tongue after just a few bites. If that doesn’t tell you how bad it is maybe the fact that the first two ingredients are soybean oil, followed by palm oil. There is no flavor to this stuff. It simply leaves your popcorn feeling and tasting oily. No yummy movie theater flavor that other reviews have stated ( did these people even try it!) I LOVE me some movie theater popcorn (truly the only reason I go to the theater). This left me feeling very disappointed.",0

The consistency is ok, but it has basically no discernable flavor and doesn't taste the least bit buttery, just oily. The bottle has a wide opening at the top and is terrible to try to pour...if you pour fast enough so it doesn't run down the side, you get WAY too much on your popcorn - yuck. If you pour slow enough to keep a moderate amount on the popcorn, it catches on the opening and runs down the side and makes a big mess. I say pass on this.",0

I found it at a local farmer's market and thought I'd give it a shot, thinking it was local. It was completely horrible. It didn't taste or smell remotely like butter. It had a strangely sweet, decaying smell. We threw the whole thing in the garbage. I found an Orville Redenbacher's popcorn oil/topping and we just use that, along with a butter flavor shaker from Kernel's Secret. It's pretty good, and you don't have to add additional salt.",0
B00AX6JGI8,2014-07-17,AE2VWXCIQMFP4ANY74CDQ2YYUHRA,Sandy Rivers Ranch,3.0,Not as great as I thought it would be,"  I read other reviews and decided to try this topping for my popcorn. I have tried other butter flavor toppings so I feel I can compare it fairly. I was not impressed. First of all this is only soy bean oil with artificial butter flavor and beta carotene for color. It had an oily flavor, very mild butter flavor, as a matter of fact, not much butter flavor at all. It has that oily butter topping sorta flavor we find at the theater, but not as flavorful. I find that the price paid could not justify the product. I am sure there is a huge markup and profit based on the actual contents. It is hard to find products that imitate the real thing we want in this world of artificial flavor, so my input here is to spend $3 on a pound of real butter, spend a little time and clarify it, and that flavor cannot be reproduced by soy bean oil as it is the real thing. This is what I decided to do and the real butter on my real popcorn is the best you can get.",0

B00AX6JGI8,2017-02-09,AFSPOOGQX6WYA7RXU4DQZWXEYHEQ,Melissa,5.0,Good flavor,"  I got a bottle of this topping as part of my Christmas present. I usually use Supurkist II, as that's what a lot of the movie theaters use. I really like the flavor of this topping. I use Flavacol in the kettle with coconut oil when popping the corn. I also have a salt shaker for Flavacol in case someone likes their popcorn extra salty.    I made a batch of popcorn and dished some up in two popcorn buckets. I used Amish Country on one, and the Supurkist II on the other. My family preferred the Amish Country. Both were good, but the flavor was just a little better on the AC batch.    I don't pour it out of the included container. I use a small squeeze bottle that is meant for melting chocolate. That way I can microwave it for 20-30 seconds and have more control over how much drizzles on the popcorn. I like this product and will definitely be buying it again.",0

Nobody in the family wanted ANY on theirs after trying it from our first batch. We basically threw that batch away. As for the container it came in, the pour spout opening is very extreme and is a poor design. The topping pours out WAY too fast and dribbles on the the lid it's pouring out of and basically dribbles down the side of the bottle when turned upright. I'll pass on this one.

Absolutely wonderful. Crispy/crunchy just the way good popcorn should be.

They will eat the cheap microwave popcorn that is so salty it leaves you feeling parched with a raw tongue after just a few bites. If that doesn’t tell you how bad it is maybe the fact that the first two ingredients are soybean oil, followed by palm oil. There is no flavor to this stuff. It simply leaves your popcorn feeling and tasting oily. No yummy movie theater flavor that other reviews have stated ( did these people even try it!) I LOVE me some movie theater popcorn (truly the only reason I go to the theater). This left me feeling very disappointed.",0

The consistency is ok, but it has basically no discernable flavor and doesn't taste the least bit buttery, just oily. The bottle has a wide opening at the top and is terrible to try to pour...if you pour fast enough so it doesn't run down the side, you get WAY too much on your popcorn - yuck. If you pour slow enough to keep a moderate amount on the popcorn, it catches on the opening and runs down the side and makes a big mess. I say pass on this.",0

I found it at a local farmer's market and thought I'd give it a shot, thinking it was local. It was completely horrible. It didn't taste or smell remotely like butter. It had a strangely sweet, decaying smell. We threw the whole thing in the garbage. I found an Orville Redenbacher's popcorn oil/topping and we just use that, along with a butter flavor shaker from Kernel's Secret. It's pretty good, and you don't have to add additional salt.",0
B075FD8XLP,2014-07-17,AE2VWXCIQMFP4ANY74CDQ2YYUHRA,Sandy Rivers Ranch,3.0,Not as great as I thought it would be,"  I read other reviews and decided to try this topping for my popcorn. I have tried other butter flavor toppings so I feel I can compare it fairly. I was not impressed. First of all this is only soy bean oil with artificial butter flavor and beta carotene for color. It had an oily flavor, very mild butter flavor, as a matter of fact, not much butter flavor at all. It has that oily butter topping sorta flavor we find at the theater, but not as flavorful. I find that the price paid could not justify the product. I am sure there is a huge markup and profit based on the actual contents. It is hard to find products that imitate the real thing we want in this world of artificial flavor, so my input here is to spend $3 on a pound of real butter, spend a little time and clarify it, and that flavor cannot be reproduced by soy bean oil as it is the real thing. This is what I decided to do and the real butter on my real popcorn is the best you can get.",0

I usually use Supurkist II, as that's what a lot of the movie theaters use. I really like the flavor of this topping. I use Flavacol in the kettle with coconut oil when popping the corn. I also have a salt shaker for Flavacol in case someone likes their popcorn extra salty.    I made a batch of popcorn and dished some up in two popcorn buckets. I used Amish Country on one, and the Supurkist II on the other. My family preferred the Amish Country. Both were good, but the flavor was just a little better on the AC batch.    I don't pour it out of the included container. I use a small squeeze bottle that is meant for melting chocolate. That way I can microwave it for 20-30 seconds and have more control over how much drizzles on the popcorn. I like this product and will definitely be buying it again.",0

Very small kernels that much small popcorn pieces. That's all good. I use a air-pop machine and it's not a great fit. Since the kernels are so small I lose about 10-15% being blown out of the machine before they even start to pop. I guess one needs a heavier kernel for air-pop machines. I have a conventional machine too and will use this up and enjoy it there. Orville is better for an air-pop so I'll return to him for that purpose.,0

I did a lot of searching before going with Amish Country, and I'm so glad I got this one! I love popcorn but hate getting the kernels stuck in my teeth, but this popcorn is so light and fluffy--and completely hullles. It makes movie nights at home super fun, and tastes WAY better than movie theatre popcorn. I usually just melt done butter with fresh sea salt and it tastes unbelievable.

Not by a long shot, but as a very decent popping corn, yes. This is very decently priced and the corn pops up nice and big and fuffy, but going thru the effort of having to have it mailed to you only works for me if I can't find popping kernels locally, and believe it or not, sometimes I really can't. Seems at the supermarket lots of times all I see on the shelves are umpteen varieties of microwave popcorn -- the lonely popcorn kernels that one needs to cook on the stove apparently that's too difficult for modern man.

It is a smaller kernel, so the popcorn is smaller too, but it is very tender and very tasty. I popped it using olive oil and coconut oil, both ways were delicious. The coconut oil gave it a light coconut flavor and the olive oil helps to give it a butter flavor. I ordered it because I wanted to try ordering hullless popcorn. To me there were still hulls, but no like regular popcorn as the hulls were much softer. I would definitely order this popcorn again. I wouldn't order the butter flavored powder again. For me, that was not edible because of the extreme, and I do mean extreme, amount of salt it gave to the popcorn, which made it inedible in my opinion. Other than that it was really good!",0

Nothing to write home about and really hard to get right.,  I love the idea of the hull-less popcorn but it's not actually hull-less. The way it's considered that is because the kernels are so small that the hulls virtually dissapear when the kernels pop. I can not think of a good use for this popcorn other than choking an infant or maybe a craft of some sort. It is way too small and getting the right amount of salt for the tasting is nearly impossible.    It's non GMO which is a plus but other than that I just can't justify the cost.,0

I don't like the idea of warming up the whole jar every time I want to use it because I think it distorts the properties of the oil. I haven't tried this yet but I think I will use a spoon heated up to very hot over my gas stove flame and use it to scoop out some oil - coconut oil melts very easily so maybe this will do the trick! Tastewise - doesn't taste like anything which is something I like since then you can flavor it any way you like. Also, my husband likes super buttery popcorn which I don't like the idea of him eating every time we have popcorn so I like that the orange tint makes him think it has more butter than it does.",1
