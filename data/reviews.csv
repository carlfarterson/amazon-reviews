B06XDJP2WX,2018-04-02,AHVKCIFXK5PXES5XKY4IHQ666JCQ,Amazon Customer,5.0,every nurse that came in our room loved it and asked where we got it from,"  We used this during our daughters first couple days.. every nurse that came in our room loved it and asked where we got it from. It is beautiful, large, and SO soft (even now after several washings). I purchased another one in a different style for myself and another for a friend's baby shower. They are all gorgeous. Totally worth the price!!! I even purchased one for my 7 year old because she loved her sister's so much! Don't hesitate to buy. Great company (Copper Pearl)!!",1
B06XDJP2WX,2018-05-30,AH6SNGJCWJP6M23Y5WZOZB6WTLXA,Whitney Jones,5.0,Lovely soft and stretchy swaddle. Just do not put ...,  Lovely soft and stretchy swaddle. Just do not put in the dryer! It will never be the same! My husband placed our other copper pearl swaddle in the dryer and it was ruined.,1
B06XDJP2WX,2017-09-16,AH3ANNXFPW5C4TPHDMXNLL4TVRAA,CADinCALI,5.0,Awesome blanket - so soft and gets tons of compliments!,"  Love this. Like one of my fave products for my daughter. It's buttery soft, very large and super comfy. I wish they made this in adult size!!    I get compliments on it everywhere I go. The seam around the edge is just a simple surge, but so far it's held up well to washing and using.    This product would make a great gift and I'm sad I didn't know to put it on my registry as I found it too late! I bought this after I had bought the matching car seat cover which I also fell in love with. Great purchase, you won't regret!",1
B06XDJP2WX,2018-05-22,AEFNSH6ROCT7KYD72XEV36QUSJKA,Robin,5.0,Sweet and soft!,"  So beautiful and soft! Very large, enough to really swaddle and keep baby warm. Fabric is thin - but with a quality and luxurious feel. Colors are soft and pastel - not as sharp and dark as they appear in pictures. Took a second picture with flash close up to hopefully show off color better. Would buy again, and as a gift. Love it.",1
B06XDJP2WX,2018-07-04,AFB2CKKMPQQUTVAQERXW5NILLS2A,Julia Peerenboom,5.0,I purchased this and the matching hat as our baby's first outfit to wear in the hospital because I loved the bright happy colors for our summer baby,"  Never thought I would be someone who purchases high end baby items, but after buying this swaddle, I am officially hooked on CopperPearl. I purchased this and the matching hat as our baby's first outfit to wear in the hospital because I loved the bright happy colors for our summer baby. I was expecting good quality, but I am honestly blown away by how soft, big and vibrant this swaddle is! The material is light and stretchy, something that will be perfect not only as a swaddle, but also as a light weight blanket when baby gets older.  The shipping and delivery process was on time and the item is even better than described- if you are on the fence about buying one of these swaddles- do it! But beware, you will want more!!",1
B06XDJP2WX,2017-07-01,AG3WUSE4PV7BFODG6T5RLVZYB4LQ,Shelli Elsten,5.0,She loves both the cover and the blanket and the pictures are beautiful with my new granddaughter wrapped up in it,"  I got my daughter the car seat/nursing cover in this same print from her registry for her baby shower. She was over and looking all over the internet for something similar for a swaddle for baby's first pictures. She looked for swaddles and I sew so we scoured the internet for fabric but couldn't find anything close enough.  After she left I thought, Amazon will have my order history, I can look there. When I did I found the exact same print in a swaddling blanket and ordered it right away.  I have no idea why neither one of us thought about looking in the same shop in the first place-she did find the shop first and wanted that cover in that print.  She loves both the cover and the blanket and the pictures are beautiful with my new granddaughter wrapped up in it.",1
B06XDJP2WX,2017-05-09,AHHVCOVZCY2YDDE3AFAZNUAN2D3Q,Heather Jarvis,5.0,Love this !,"  I love this blanket! its super big! It is very thin, which is what I expected but I have a couple of the car seat covers from this company and I think its even a little thinner that that. Just a headsup. However that is perfect for me! I want something light and airy for my baby because we are approaching summer here in Arizona and it is hot hot hot! I'll probably order the rose one they released as well because I have that print in everything else it comes in!",1
B06XDJP2WX,2018-05-18,AEQBVYNAQ5MHIUOLSRUOXHGYTY3Q,Jessica Allen,5.0,Get this for your baby or any shower gift! Its THE BEST!,  Beautiful soft baby blanket! and this floral pattern is so sophisticated while still being vibrant and fun.  LOVE LOVE LOVE! I will buy this for any girl baby showers I'm going to in the future.    PROS  -great large size so it's easy to swaddle or cover the baby but not bulky  -soft without needing to be broken in  -truely beautiful floral artistic print that is holding up already to several washes  -out of all the baby blankets my friend received she loves this the most and carries it with her everywhere! win!    CONS  -doesnt come in a queen size for me to have,1
B06XDJP2WX,2018-05-15,AF647T2S44ALEECMDVTQP4ICYHTQ,Alison,5.0,So soft and pretty,"  I have come to love Copper Pearl items as the materials are so soft and high quality. Their different patterns are so cute and it's really nice to be able to match their products to others, i.e. hats, burp cloths, blankets, etc. Very satisfied. (Now, let's hope my baby loves them, too! Ha!)",1
B06XDJP2WX,2018-05-09,AHKYB622J5LXR5VVLA2XTMT5BHPA,Jennifer G,5.0,Great blanket! Worth the $,"  LOVE this blanket! I’ve bought several (like a dozen) blankets in the last 6 months.

B06XDJP2WX,2018-06-03,AGLIMUMTCQSNSMYHP67EDISVTOMQ,Will,5.0,Heavy & Cool!!❤️ Not used for tight swaddle.,"  Our whole family loves this blanket, and our newborn is adorable wrapped up in it!    It is great to lay on the baby’s lap to add some weight and trick baby into thinking they are still being held, when they need set in a bassinet or swing. It’s not good for a nighttime swaddle when you don’t want newborn to get their arms out. The material is so stretchy our baby can always wiggle out.    It’s the softest blanket and cool feeling and heavy all at once! I highly recommend!!",1
B06XDJP2WX,2018-02-24,AEEY44C534OC7XNQWNOK33K73BWQ,Allie,5.0,The fabric is nice and stretchy and the print is so beautiful,"  I absolutely adore our Copper Pearl Swaddle blanket. The fabric is nice and stretchy and the print is so beautiful. Keep in mind that it is only one layer of fabric, but this works well if you fold it for swaddling. I ended up buying the car seat cover and crib sheet too.",1
