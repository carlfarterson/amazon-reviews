B06XDJP2WX,2018-05-04,Can you put these in the dryer? Package just says wash cold.,Those were my plans but I still have a couple months before baby so I haven't gotten there yet. I would email the ladies at copperpearl.com they are pretty quick to respond.
B06XDJP2WX,2017-11-22,"Is this two sided or floral on one side, white on the other?","It's floral on both sides. This is a REALLY nice swaddle. VERY soft! In fact, my daughter already had one of these for my Granddaughter in another color, and loved it so much she asked for this one, too, because it was so pretty."
B06XDJP2WX,2018-08-23,Is this good for hot weat her??,"This is going to be thicker than your traditional muslin swaddle but not too heavy. If using it just as a blanket, it should be fine in hot weather, but I always choose muslin blankets fit hot weather because itâ€™s a little more breathable....great as a swaddle and blanket if child is indoors."
B06XXKQP32,2018-10-01,For the seller: Would it be possible to get three burp cloths in the same pattern (Forest -- w green evergreens) instead of the variety pack pictured?,Unfortunately we cannot do that. I apologize for the inconvenience!
