These 5 in 1 covers are the absolute best though!! It keeps unwanted germy hands off our baby when we are out and about and keeps him asleep if we are out as well! It's also the best nursing cover because it covers you ALL the way around. So when I forgot to wear a nursing friendly shirt and have to pull my shirt all the way up the people behind me don't get a peak! Haha It's also great, now my baby is older, to put over the grocery cart and high chairs. Those things are nasty and i don't think a sanitizing wipe is going to do that much good!! Plus you can wear it as a scarf so when your nursing you don't have to take it off or worry about leaving it at home!

Whenever I'm out and about with these covers I always get compliments about how convenient the design is. I love that it keeps peering eyes and hands out and doesn't flip or shift when there's a gust of wind or it gets bumped (other curtain-style car seat covers totally have that problem). Another thing I love is that it's so easy to peer in from the top down - makes it so much more convenient when my car seat is on my stroller, or when I've set on the ground. I'm not always having to bend over just to peek in at my baby. As a nursing cover, I love that it gives full 360 coverage so you don't have to worry about your back being exposed when you're out in public nursing... again, something that other curtain-style covers can't offer.

In fact I went to my brothers hockey game last night and arrived with the cover over the car seat so my newborn son was protected from the crowd of people.

The material is soft and stretchy so it's comfy for my little guy and it's light and comfortable for me so I'm not dying of heat with a cover on me while nursing!

I have seen other brands selling the same type covers for double the price and was suprise to find when i tried them out that this one is higher quality! not only does it fit on the car seat perfectly it has been made with the perfect fabric to be able to pull on and off with ease. I have nursed all my kiddos and finding the right cover is always a struggle, they are either too bulky with too much fabric to control, or not enough coverage where you feel like you are exposing yourself constantly.  This cover solves ALL those problems! Not only is the fabric the perfect soft,breathable material it also covers you completely while still allowing your babe to feel like they aren't being smothered..mom as well ;) this cover is a game changer! I also love that I can easily slip it off at the grocery store to keep my babes germ free and be able to slip it back on hassle free unlike other covers I have had in the past! The only thing I wish is I had had this cover with all my babes! No more carrying bulky items for carseats,feeding,and shopping this product is one item that is easily stored and used making space in our diaper bag for more important things like extra snacks!!

The patterns looked cute and modern on-line, but in real life look cheesy and cheap.  Sort of like a grandma's nightgown.  I am giving it as a gift, and the packaging is poor -- the paper label is not attached to the bibs themselves, but is just folded around them.  And the label ""Copper Pearl"" is about 1"" big (large), and is sewn tightly on the front of each bib (I didn't notice it when I was ordering) -- written in a cheesy looking cursive script.  Not sure why it's necessary for the baby who is wearing these to have a big advertisement around her neck.  I'm embarrassed to be giving these to my niece, but since I don't have time to return and order something else, I guess that's what I'll have to do.

My little one is a heavy drooler, and these bibs have saved us from having to change outfits 3-4 times a day.  We do, however, go through at least 3-4 of these a day because there's only so much it can absorb before it starts to wreak of baby drool and upchuck.  I took off one star only because these are not made of organic cotton.  My baby loves to munch and chew on her bib as she is teething, so it would be great if Copper Pearl had an organic option.

She is an early teether and has been drooling constantly.  I was looking for a more absorbent bib that can be tossed in the washer and dryer without a waterproof plastic liner when I came across this set on Amazon.  I'm so happy I went with this product after reading all of the positive reviews.  The fleece back really does keep my baby dry for several hours.  I do find myself going through 2-3 of these bibs throughout the day because the front of the bib will become soaked.  My daughter is just beginning to eat solids, and based on the other reviews, I use a different bib while she eats and use these solely as drool bibs for when she is awake.  I also like how the bib has button snaps as the velcro bibs tend to stick to other clothing in the dryer.  The bandana bib style works well to provide full coverage under my daughter's chin.

It is a little hard to get little one latched because the stretch fabric has to be held out for you to see in, so sometimes I just duck my head under and then pull it down once she's on. It's a little annoying but worth it to have *total* coverage even from above. I loved using it to cover her carseat when she was little, too. You can see in through the hole where the handle sticks out. The black and white contrast is good for their little eyes - she seems mesmerized while nursing or riding in her carseat under it, so I'll take it as I know not all babies will tolerate nursing with a cover. I have washed and dried it several times and it's holding up great so far. I will definitely give this as a baby shower gift in the future! Seems to perform just as well as some more expensive, similar brands.

After seeing a tunic style nursing cover on a friend, this time around I realized I wanted one like hers that would cover my whole body so my sides/belly/back wouldn't be exposed when I lifted up my shirt (when not wearing a nursing tank/top).  This one does that.  It's stretchy but gives me the privacy I need and is much more discreet than the nursing covers that only cover the front.  The fabric is nice and lightweight but not at all see through.  I've used it as a car seat cover and really like it for that as well as nursing.  I don't like the car seat canopy covers because being thick minky fabric I think they restrict air flow.  This one I feel good about because it is lightweight and breathable, and you can position the opening so it lets in air if you want, or place the opening further back onto the hood of your car seat if you don't.  It must be a hit because I've seen 2-3 mothers with it around Las Vegas already.  I've washed it a few times and have been letting it air dry to keep it in good shape and avoid piling (which I saw on one of the ones I saw around town).  I bought it mainly for it's use as a nursing cover, the car set cover aspect and cart/high chair cover aspect are bonus for me.  I'm glad I bought it and will recommend it to friends.",You can pull your shirt up and no one will see!
